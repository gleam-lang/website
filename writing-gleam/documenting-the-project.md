If our project is a library it is important that it is well documented so that
people understand how to use the code.

## Modules and functions

To document modules and functions Gleam supports two special comments, `///`
which is for documenting types and functions, and `////` which is for
documenting the module as a whole.

```gleam
//// This module contains some useful functions for working
//// with numbers.
////
//// For more information see [this website](https://example.com).


import gleam/result

/// A type for representing numbers
pub type Number {
  /// This constructor is used when the number is an Int
  I(Int)

  /// This constructor is used when the number is an Float
  F(Float)
}

/// Returns the next number
///
/// # Examples
///
///   > successor(1)
///   2
///
pub fn successor(i: Int) -> Int {
  i + 1
}

/// Returns a number held by an Ok record, returning a default if the
/// Result is an Error record.
///
/// # Examples
///
///   > from_result(Ok(1))
///   1
///
///   > from_result(Error(Nil))
///   0
///
pub fn from_result(result: Result(Int, e)) -> Int {
  result.unwrap(result, 0)
}
```

Once documentation comments have been added Gleam can generate HTML
documentation for the project.

## Additional documentation pages

To add additional pages to the documentation for the project that aren't
automatically generated, simply define them in Markdown and add them to
`gleam.toml` as follows:

```toml
name = "my_awesome_gleam_app"

[documentation]
pages = [
  { title = "Hello", path = "hello.html", source = "docs/hello_world.md" },
  { title = "Testing", path = "testing.html", source = "docs/testing.md" },
]

```

Links will automatically be generated for these additional pages and the
Markdown will be converted into HTML documentation.

Your project's `README.md` file will automatically be used to generate the
default page for the documentation.

## Building documentation

The documentation can be built locally using this command, which renders the
documentation to the build directory.

```sh
gleam docs build
```
