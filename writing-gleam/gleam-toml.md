# Accepted values are "erlang" and "javascript". Defaults to "erlang".
target = "erlang"

# The source code repository location (optional)
# This will be used in generated documentation and displayed on Hex.
repository = { type = "github", user = "example", repo = "my_project" }
# It can also be one of these formats
# repository = { type = "gitlab", user = "example", repo = "my_project" }
# repository = { type = "bitbucket", user = "example", repo = "my_project" }
# repository = { type = "custom", url = "https://example.com/my_project" }
