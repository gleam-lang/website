## Comments

### TypeScript

In TypeScript, comments are written with a `//` prefix.

```ts
// Hello, Joe!
```

Multi-line comments may be written like so:

```ts
/*
 * Hello, Joe!
 */
```

TypeScript also [supports JSDoc annotations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html).

```ts
/**
 * @type {string}
 */
var s;
 
/** @type {Window} */
var win;
 
/** @type {PromiseLike<string>} */
var promisedString;
 
// You can specify an HTML Element with DOM properties
/** @type {HTMLElement} */
var myElement = document.querySelector(selector);
element.dataset.myData = "";
```

Documentation blocks (docblocks) are extracted into generated API
documentation.

### Gleam

In Gleam, comments are written with a `//` prefix.

```gleam
// Hello, Joe!
```

Comments starting with `///` are used to document the following function,
constant, or type definition. Comments starting with `////` are used to
document the current module.

```gleam
//// This module is very important.

/// The answer to life, the universe, and everything.
const answer: Int = 42

/// A main function
fn main() {}

/// A Dog type
type Dog {
  Dog(name: String, cuteness: Int)
}
```

`//` comments are not used while generating documentation files, while
`////` and `///` will appear in them.

## Variables

You can rebind variables in both languages.

### TypeScript

```ts
let a = 50;
a = a + 100;
a = 1;
```

### Gleam

Gleam also has the `let` keyword before its variable names. However, it needs to be used explicitly each time when rebinding/reassinging a new value.

```gleam
let size = 50
let size = size + 100
let size = 1
```
## Constants

### TypeScript

In TypeScript, `const` is used for variables that may not be reassigned.

```ts
const example = 50;
example = 100; // throws "TypeError: Assignment to constant variable."
```

### Gleam

In Gleam constants can also be created using the `const` keyword. Constants must be literal values, defined at the top level of a module and functions cannot be used in their definitions.

```gleam
// the_question.gleam module
const the_answer = 42

pub fn main() {
  the_answer
}
```

They can also be marked public via the `pub` keyword and will then be
automatically exported.

```gleam
pub const the answer = 42
```
## Variables type annotations

### TypeScript

TypeScript has optional type annotations (depending on compiler configuration).

```ts
const example1: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
const example2: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3]; // equivalent to example 1
const example3: [number, number, number] = [1, 2, 3];
const example4 = [1, 2, 3]; // valid, inferred without explicit type annotation
```

### Gleam

In Gleam type annotations can optionally be given when binding variables.

```gleam
let some_list: List(Int) = [1, 2, 3]
let some_string: String = "Foo"
let another_string = "Bar" // valid, inferred without explicit type annotation
```

Gleam will check the type annotation to ensure that it matches the type of the
assigned value. It does not need annotations to type check your code, but you
may find it useful to annotate variables to hint to the compiler that you want
a specific type to be inferred.

## Data types

### Strings

In TypeScript (JavaScript), strings are represented fundamentally as sequences
of UTF-16 code units. They can be defined with single quotes, double quotes,
or back-ticks (also known as template strings). Interpolation is supported in
template literal strings.

In Gleam all strings are UTF-8 encoded binaries. Gleam strings do not allow
interpolation, yet. Gleam however offers a `string_builder` via its standard
library for performant string building.

#### TypeScript

```ts
const firstExample = 'one';
const secondExample = "two";
const thirdExample = `three`;

const concat1 = 'one' + 'example';
const concat2 = "two" + "example";
const concat3 = `${concat1} ${concat2}`;
```


#### Gleam

```gleam
let example = "Hell√∏, world!"
let another = "Hello" <> ", world!"
```

### Numbers

#### TypeScript

TypeScript (JavaScript) only has a single number type implemented as a double-precision
64-bit binary format IEEE 754 value.

```typescript
1 / 2 // 0.5
```

#### Gleam

```gleam
1 / 2 // 0
1.5 + 10 // Compile time error
```

You can use the gleam standard library's `int` and `float` modules to convert
between floats and integers in various ways including `rounding`, `floor`,
`ceiling` and many more.

Floats in gleam use float-specific operators like `+.` and `/.` instead of sharing `+` and `/`.

```gleam
1 / 2 // 0
1.0 /. 2.0 // 0.5
```

### Arrays and Lists

Arrays in TypeScript are allowed to have values of mixed types, but lists in Gleam can only have a single type.

#### TypeScript

TypeScript has arrays that support mixed types.

```ts
const arrayOfNumbers = [2, 3, 4];
const arr2 = [1, "wow", true];
const arr3: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
const arr4: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3]; // eqvuialent

const arr5: Array<string|number> = [1, "2", 3]; // Valid. Array of numbers and/or strings
const arr6: number[] | string[] = [1, 2, 3]; // Valid. Array of numbers OR array of strings
const arr7: number[] | string[] = ["one", "two", "three"]; // Valid
const arr6: number[] | string[] = ["one", 2, "three"]; // Invalid
```

#### Gleam

Gleam has a `cons` operator that works for lists destructuring and
pattern matching. In Gleam lists are immutable so adding and removing elements
from the start of a list is highly efficient.

```gleam
let list = [2, 3, 4]
let list = [1, ..list]
let [1, second_element, ..] = list
[1.0, ..list] // compile error, type mismatch
```

### Tuples

#### TypeScript

TypeScript supports tuple types for arrays. They must be explicitly declared.

```ts
const a: [number, number] = [1, 2]; // valid
const b: [number, number] = [1, 2, 3]; // not valid
const c = [1, 2]; // inferred type is number[], NOT a tuple
const d: [string, number] = ["wow", 42];
```

#### Gleam

Tuples are very useful in Gleam as they're the only collection data type that
allows mixed types in the collection.

```gleam
let my_tuple = #("username", "password", 10)
let #(_, pwd, _) = my_tuple
io.print(pwd) // "password"
// Direct index access
io.print(my_tuple.0) // "username"
```


### Destructuring Arrays and Tuples

#### TypeScript

TypeScript supports destructuring arrays with `const` or `let` statements.

```ts 
type NumberArray = number[];
type NumberPair = [number, number]; // tuple

const [a, b]: NumberArray = [1, 2]; // the type annotation here is not required
console.log(a); // 1
console.log(b); // 2

const [c]: NumberPair = [3, 4]; // the type annotation here is not required
console.log(c); // 3

const [d, ...e] = [5, 6, 7, 8];
console.log(d); // 5
console.log(e); // [6, 7, 8]
```

#### Gleam

Similar syntax is supported in Gleam for tuples. However, variadic destructuring is not.

```gleam
let #(a, b) = #(1, 2)

io.debug(a) // 1
io.debug(b) // 2

let #(c, _) = #(3, 4)
io.debug(c) // 3
// _ ignores the 4
```

For lists, the `list.split` method may be used.

```gleam
import gleam/io
import gleam/list

pub fn main() {
  let ints = [11, 22, 33]

  let #(a, rest) = list.split(ints, 1)

  io.debug(a) // [11]
  io.debug(rest) // [22, 33]
}
```

### Objects, Records, and Maps

The data structures in TypeScript and Gleam don't quite align one-to-one. TypeScript
has objects (which can be typed as a record) and maps. Gleam has dictionaries.

#### TypeScript

```ts
const obj = {
  a: 1,
  b: 'two',
  c: {
    neat: true,
  }
}

obj.a; // 1
obj['a']; // 1
obj.c.neat; // true;
```

There are several ways to types objects in TypeScript. They provide a Record type,
however, it is not a true record. Though, there is [a proposal to add true records
and tuples](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-record-tuple) to JavaScript.

```ts
const obj1: { a: number } = { a: 1 };
const obj2: { [key: string]: number } = { a: 1};
const obj3: Record<string, number> = { a: 1 };

{a: 1} === {a: 1} // false
{a: 1} == {a: 1} // false
```

Maps in TypeScript are a class that are similar to objects, but separate.

```ts
const myMap = new Map<string, number>;

myMap.set('a', 1);
myMap.has('a'); // true
myMap.get('a'); // 1
```

#### Gleam

A dict, in Gleam, is a collection of keys and values which other languages may call a hashmap or table.

```gleam
import gleam/io
import gleam/dict

pub fn main() {
  let scores = dict.from_list([#("Lucy", 13), #("Drew", 15)])
  io.debug(scores) // dict.from_list([#("Drew", 15), #("Lucy", 13)])

  let scores =
    scores
    |> dict.insert("Bushra", 16)
    |> dict.insert("Darius", 14)
    |> dict.delete("Drew")
  io.debug(scores) // dict.from_list([#("Darius", 14), #("Bushra", 16), #("Lucy", 13)])
}
```

### Sets

A set is a collection of unique members. Both TypeScript and Gleam support sets.

#### TypeScript

A set in TypeScript can a set can have multiple types.

```ts
const nums = new Set();

nums.add(1);
nums.has(1); // true
nums.has(999); // false
nums.add('12'); // no runtime enforcement of types
nums.has('12') // true

const strictNums = new Set<number>(); // example declaration to limit type (at compile time)
```

#### Gleam

In Gleam, a set can only have a single type of value.

```gleam
import gleam/set

set.new()
|> set.insert(2)
|> set.contains(2)
// -> True
```
## Functions

Both TypeScript and Gleam have first-class functions. Both support functions as values,
as well as higher-order functions, partial application, currying, and similar patterns.

### TypeScript

```ts
// Traditional function declaration
function example4() {
  return 'a';
}

// Declaration as a variable with an anonymous function
const example2 = function() {
  return 'b';
}

// Anonymous arrow function expressions
const example3 = () => 'c'; // implicit return
const addOne = x => x + 1; // single arguments don't require parentheses

const example4 = example3; // functions can be passed as values

example4(); // 'c'
```

### Gleam

The basic syntax for functions in Gleam is similar. One key difference is that the last
expression in a function is returned implicitly without a `return` keyword.

```gleam
fn identity(x) {
  x
}

fn main() {
  let func = identity
  func(100) // 100

  let func2 = fn() { "b" }

  func2() // "b"
}
```

## Blocks

### Gleam

Gleam has support for blocks, which are similar to functions without arguments.

```gleam
let example = {
  let ratio = get_ratio()
  some_value * ratio()
}

// Also used for explicit math precendence.
let total = { x - 3} * 12
```

### TypeScript

The equivalent in TypeScript would be an [IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE).

```ts
const example = (() => {
  const ratio = getRatio();

  return someValue * ratio;
})();
```

## Flow Control

### Conditionals

#### TypeScript

```ts
if (x === 1) {
  console.log('one');
} else if (x === 2) {
  console.log('two');
} else {
  console.log('something else');
}
```

#### Gleam

Gleam does not have the same if/else syntax and uses `case` statements/expressions instead.

if/else example:

```gleam
case is_admin {
  True -> "allow access"
  False -> "disallow access"
}
```

if/elseif/else example:

```gleam
pub fn main() {
  let x = 3
  let y = 2
  
  let result = case x {
    // Match specific values
    // "if x is 0..."
    0 -> {

      // Nested case expression
      // "and y is..."
      case y {
        1 -> "hello"
        _ -> "goodbye"
      }
    } 
    // "else if x is 1"
    1 -> "One"

    // Match any other value
    // "else..."
    _ -> "Other"
  }

  io.debug(result)
}
```

### Switch and Case

#### TypeScript

TypeScript has simple switch statements that allow for some basic matching of a value.

There is a language proposal for [a pattern matching syntax](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pattern-matching).

```ts
switch (num) {
  case 1:
    console.log('one');
    break;
  case 2:
  case 3:
    console.log('two or three');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('something else');
}
```

#### Gleam

Case statements in Gleam are robust and allow for pattern matching.

```gleam
case some_number {
  0 -> "Zero"
  1 -> "One"
  2 -> "Two"
  n -> "Some other number" // This matches anything
}
```

As all expressions the case expression will return the matched value.

They can be used to mimick if/else or if/elseif/else, with the exception that
any branch must return unlike in TypeScript, where it is possible to mutate a
variable of the outer block/scope and not return at all.

```gleam
let is_status_within_4xx = status / 400 == 1
case status {
  400 -> "Bad Request"
  404 -> "Not Found"
  _ if is_status_within_4xx -> "4xx" // This works as of now
  // status if status / 400 == 1 -> "4xx" // This will work in future versions of Gleam
  _ -> "I'm not sure"
}
```

Exhaustiveness checking at compile time, which is in the works, will make
certain that you must check for all possible values. A lazy and common way is
to check of expected values and have a catchall clause with a single underscore
`_`:

```gleam
case scale {
  0 -> "none"
  1 -> "one"
  2 -> "pair"
  _ -> "many"
}
```

The case operator especially coupled with destructuring to provide native pattern
matching:

```gleam
case xs {
  [] -> "This list is empty"
  [a] -> "This list has 1 element"
  [a, b] -> "This list has 2 elements"
  _other -> "This list has more than 2 elements"
}
```

The case operator supports guards:

```gleam
case xs {
  [a, b, c] if a >. b && a <=. c -> "ok"
  _other -> "ko"
}
```

...and disjoint union matching:

```gleam
case number {
  2 | 4 | 6 | 8 -> "This is an even number"
  1 | 3 | 5 | 7 -> "This is an odd number"
  _ -> "I'm not sure"
}
```

### Piping

In Gleam most functions, if not all, are data first, which means the main data
value to work on is the first argument. By this convention and the ability to
specify the argument to pipe into, Gleam allows writing functional, immutable
code, that reads imperative-style top down, much like unix tools and piping.

#### TypeScript

TypeScript does not offer pipes (yet, although there's [a proposal for a pipeline operator](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator)) but it can chain calls by making functions return
objects which in turn ship with their list of methods.

```ts
const value = add(1, subtract(multiply(1, 2), 1));
```

#### Gleam

```gleam
100
|> multiply(2)
|> subtract(1)
|> add(1)
```


### Try

Error management is approached differently in TypeScript and Gleam.

#### TypeScript

TypeScript uses the notion of exceptions to interrupt the current code flow and
bubble up the error to the caller.

An exception is raised using the keyword `throw`.

```ts
function aFunctionThatFails() {
  throw new Error('an error');
}
```

The callee block will be able to capture any exception raised in the block
using a `try/except` set of blocks:

```ts
try {
  // callee block
  console.log('this line will be executed and thus printed');
  aFunctionThatFails();
  console.log('this line will not be executed and thus not printed');
} catch (err) {
  console.error(err)
}
```

#### Gleam

In contrast in gleam, errors are just containers with an associated value.

A common container to model an operation result is
`Result(ReturnType, ErrorType)`.

A `Result` is either:

- an `Error(ErrorValue)`
- or an `Ok(Data)` record

Handling errors actually means to match the return value against those two
scenarios, using a case for instance:

```gleam
case parse_int("123") {
  Ok(i) -> io.println("We parsed the Int")
  Error(e) -> io.println("That wasn't an Int")
}
```

In order to simplify this construct, we can use the `try` keyword that will:

- either bind a value to the providing name if `Ok(Something)` is matched,
- or **interrupt the current block's flow** and return `Error(Something)` from
  the given block.

```gleam
let a_number = "1"
let an_error = Error("ouch")
let another_number = "3"

try int_a_number = parse_int(a_number)
try attempt_int = parse_int(an_error) // Error will be returned
try int_another_number = parse_int(another_number) // never gets executed

Ok(int_a_number + attempt_int + int_another_number) // never gets executed
```

## Modules

### TypeScript

```ts
import example from './my-module';

export const myFunction = () => {
  example();
}
```

### Gleam

```gleam
import gleam/io

pub fn main() {
  io.debug(12)
}
```

Gleam also has unqualified imports to access exports more directly. However,
it is recommended to use the qualfied syntax like `io.debug(12)`.

```gleam
import gleam/io.{debug}

pub fn main() {
  debug(12)
  io.debug(12) // still valid
}
```
