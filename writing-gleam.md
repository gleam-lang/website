This guide shows you how to create and develop a Gleam project.

It does not teach the Gleam language itself, so read through [the language tour][tour] 
first if you have not already. You are assumed to already have Gleam and Erlang
installed, so head over to [the install guide][install] if you need to do that.

[tour]: https://tour.gleam.run/
[install]: /getting-started/installing/

Ready? Let's go!


## The project

In this guide we're going to make a small command line program for printing
environment variables.

In use it'll look like this:
```sh
gleam run get USER
# USER=lucy
```


## Creating a project

Gleam's build tool is built into the `gleam` program you installed earlier. It
supports creating new projects, building, testing, and running them, along with
managing dependencies from the [Hex package manager][hex].

[hex]: https://hex.pm/

First create a new Gleam project by running the `gleam new` command in a
terminal. I'm going to call mine `vars`.
```sh
# Create the project
gleam new vars

# Navigate into the project directory
cd vars
```

You'll now have a project with this structure:
```sh
.
├── .github/workflows/test.yml
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── gleam.toml
├── src/vars.gleam
└── test/vars.gleam
```

- `README.md` file is where you'd write introductory documentation for your
  project in markdown format.
- `gleam.toml` file contains the configuration for the project. 
- `src/` contains the program source.
- `test/` contains additional code for testing the project.
- `.gitignore` contains configuration for the `git` version control system.
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` defines a [GitHub Actions][actions] workflow that
  will run the project's tests if you push it to a GitHub repository.

Altogether this is called a Gleam package, regardless of whether it's a library
or a program that is run directly.

[actions]: https://github.com/features/actions


## Running the project

The entrypoint for the program is the function called `main` in the module with
the same name as the package itself. `gleam new` will have generated one for you
that looks like this:

```gleam
// In src/vars.gleam
import gleam/io

pub fn main() {
  io.println("Hello from vars!")
}
```

In the terminal run this command to run the project.
```sh
gleam run
```

The Gleam build tool will then download the dependencies (here the standard
library and a test runner), compile all the code, and then run the `main`
function to print "Hello from vars!" to the terminal.

If you wanted to run a different module in your package, or a module from a
dependency, you could run `gleam run -m modulename`.

You can run `gleam run --target javascript` to run the project on a JavaScript
runtime instead of Erlang, though for the rest of this guide we'll continue with
Erlang.


## Adding dependencies

Gleam can run in constrained environments like embedded systems or browsers, so
some functionality is not included in the standard library, such as reading
command line inputs and environment variables. For our program to do these we'll
need to add some dependencies that provide this functionality.

The [Gleam Package Index][index] can be used to find packages. In this case we
want to use [envoy][envoy] for environment variables and [argv][argv] for
reading command line input. Add them to your package with this command:

[index]: https://packages.gleam.run/
[envoy]: https://hexdocs.pm/envoy/
[argv]: https://hexdocs.pm/argv/

```sh
gleam add envoy argv
```
If you look at the `gleam.toml` file you'll see that the dependencies have been
added to the `[dependencies]` section.
```toml
name = "backlog"
version = "1.0.0"

[dependencies]
gleam_stdlib = "~> 1.0"
envoy = "~> 1.0"
argv = "~> 1.0"

[dev-dependencies]
gleeunit = "~> 1.0"
```

The `~> 1.0` version constraint means that the project wants any version greater
than or equal to 1.0, but less than 2.0, which will maximise compatibility while
avoiding breaking changes as Hex packages adhere to [semantic versioning][semver].

[semver]: https://semver.org/

There is now also a `manifest.toml` file which locks all the dependency packages
to specific versions. It's recommended to check this file into your version
control system to ensure that anyone who downloads and runs your project will
get the same versions of the dependencies. This manifest file isn't uploaded to
Hex so it is not used when other projects depend on your project.

If you wish to update the dependencies to the latest versions that are
compatible with your version constraints you can run `gleam update`.

You can also use path dependencies to depend on packages on your computer rather
than from Hex. 
```
[dependencies]
my_other_package = { path = "../my_other_package" }
```

## Using dependencies

The `argv` module from the package of the same name exports a function called
`load` that can be used to read the command line arguments. Update the
code in `src/vars.gleam` to use this function.

```gleam
import argv
import envoy
import gleam/io
import gleam/result

pub fn main() {
  case argv.load().arguments {
    ["get", name] -> get(name)
    _ -> io.println("Usage: vars get <name>")
  }
}

fn get(name: String) -> Nil {
  let value = envoy.get(name) |> result.unwrap("")
  io.println(format_pair(name, value))
}

fn format_pair(name: String, value: String) -> String {
  name <> "=" <> value
}
```

Pattern matching is being used to call the `get` function or print a help
message based on the command line arguments.

The `get` function uses the `envoy` module from the package of the same name to
read the environment variable and print it or a message if it doesn't exist. A
helper function `format_pair` is used to format the output.

Give it a try! Run `gleam run get TERM` in the terminal to recompile and run the
program.


## Testing your code

This program is so small that you likely don't need to write any tests for it,
but for the sake of demonstration let's write some for the `format_pair`
function.

To call the `format_pair` function from a module in the `test/` directory we
will need to make it public. We don't want it to be part of the public API of the
package, so we'll move it to an _internal module_, which by default are modules
named `packagename/internal` and `packagename/internal/*`.

Public functions in these modules can be imported by other modules, but they're
considered to be part of the package's internal implementation and as such are
not documented or expected to give the same stability guarantees as functions in
the public API.

```gleam
// in src/vars.gleam
import argv
import envoy
import gleam/io
import gleam/result
import vars/internal

pub fn main() {
  // Omitted for brevity
}

fn get(name: String) -> Nil {
  let value = envoy.get(name) |> result.unwrap("")
  io.println(internal.format_pair(name, value))
}
```
```gleam
// in src/vars/internal.gleam
pub fn format_pair(name: String, value: String) -> String {
  name <> "=" <> value
}
```

Open up the `test/vars_test.gleam` file and write a test for the `format_pair`.
```gleam
// in test/vars_test.gleam
import gleeunit
import gleeunit/should
import vars/internal

pub fn main() {
  gleeunit.main()
}

pub fn format_pair_test() {
  internal.format_pair("hello", "world")
  |> should.equal("hello=world")
}
```
Running `gleam test` will call the `main` function in `vars_test`, which will in
turn run the tests.

Your test `main` function can do anything you like, but by default Gleam
projects are generated using [`gleeunit`][gleeunit], a simple test runner. With
it any public function in the `test/` directory with a name ending in `_test`
will be run as a test.

[gleeunit]: https://hexdocs.pm/gleeunit/


## Sharing your program

If your program is a web application that runs on a server you may now wish to
view the [deployment section][deployment] of Gleam's documentation. The program
we've just made is a command line program, so instead we'll want to bundle it up
into a single file that can be easily shared with others.

[deployment]: /documentation/#deployment

As we're using the Erlang target we can do this using _escript_, which is part
of the Erlang runtime. Add the `gleescript` package as a dependency.

```sh
gleam add --dev gleescript
```

The `--dev` flag is used to indicate that this package is only used for building,
developing, and testing the project, and should not be included in the final
production builds. The build tool will then add `gleescript` to the
`[dev-dependencies]` section rather than the regular `[dependencies]` section.

Once added run `gleam run -m gleescript` to compile your package into an escript
file, which will be written to `./vars`.

```sh
# Compile the program to an escript
gleam run -m gleescript

# Make the escript executable
chmod +x ./vars

# Run the program
./vars get USER
```

This `vars` file can be run on any computer that has a compatible version of
Erlang installed. Typically this will be within a few major versions of the
version of Erlang on the computer used to compile the escript.
