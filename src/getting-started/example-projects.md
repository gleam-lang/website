# Example projects

When learning a new language it can often be useful to have example code to
refer to and learn from, so here are some examples:


## [Tiny: URL shortener](https://github.com/gleam-lang/example-url-shortener)


A simple HTML serving web application that takes URLs and gives the user a
shorter URL to use in its place.

Uses the Elli web server and the Postgresql database via the epgsql client.


## [The Gleam standard library](https://github.com/gleam-lang/stdlib)

A collection of modules for working with the common data structures of Gleam.


## [Gleam Experiments](https://github.com/gleam-experiments)

The Gleam Experiments GitHub organisation is home to many useful libraries
for use in Gleam projects such as OTP bindings, database clients, and lazy
data structures.
