# Installing Erlang

Gleam compiles to Erlang code, so Erlang needs to be installed to run Gleam
code.

Precompiled builds for many popular operating systems can be downloaded from
the [Erlang solutions website](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/download.html).

Guides for installing Erlang on specific operating systems can be found below,
as well as information on installing multiple versions of Erlang at once using
version management tools.

Once Erlang has been installed you can check it is working by typing `erl
-version` in your computer's terminal. You will see version information like
this if all is well:

```
$ erl -version
Erlang (SMP,ASYNC_THREADS,HIPE) (BEAM) emulator version 10.1
```
