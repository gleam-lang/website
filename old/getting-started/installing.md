To prepare your computer for Gleam development you'll need to install Gleam,
Erlang, and optionally install any Gleam plugins
for your editor.

## Installing Gleam

### Precompiled for amd64 Linux, Windows, and macOS

The easiest way to install Gleam on Linux, Windows, and Apple macOS is to download a
prebuilt version of the compiler from the [GitHub release
page](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases).

### macOS

#### Using Homebrew

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed run the following:

```sh
brew update
brew install gleam
```

#### Using MacPorts

With [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) installed run the following:

```sh
sudo port install gleam
```

### Linux

#### Using Homebrew

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed run the following:

```sh
brew update
brew install gleam
```

#### asdf version manager

[asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) is a tool for installing and managing
multiple versions of programming languages at the same time. Install the
[asdf-gleam plugin](https://github.com/vic/asdf-gleam) to manage Gleam with
asdf.

#### Alpine Linux

Gleam is available in the Community repository of Alpine Linux as a package `gleam`. Install it with:

```
apk add gleam
```

#### Arch Linux

Gleam is available through the [Arch User Repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository)
as package `gleam`. You can use your preferred [helper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_helpers)
to install it or clone it for manual build from [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gleam-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/gleam-git).
```sh
yay -S gleam
```

#### Gentoo Linux

Gleam is available in the official package manager, but may need to be unmasked. Install it with:

```sh
sudo echo "dev-lang/gleam ~amd64" >> /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
emerge --ask dev-lang/gleam
```

#### Void Linux

Gleam is available as part of the official packages repository. Install it with:

```
sudo xbps-install gleam
```

#### Fedora

You can install Gleam on Fedora using the DNF package manager. Run the following command:

```sh
sudo dnf copr enable frostyx/gleam
sudo dnf install gleam
```

### FreeBSD

Gleam is available in ports, and also in binary packages. You may need
to use the `latest` package repo, amend per instructions in
`/etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf`. See below for adjusting your PATH to use latest
Erlang/OTP runtime and not just the standard OTP21:

```
$ pkg install -r FreeBSD lang/gleam lang/erlang-runtime23
$ export PATH=/usr/local/lib/erlang23/bin:$PATH
```

### OpenBSD

Gleam is available as a binary package. You can install it with:

```
$ doas pkg_add gleam
```

### openSUSE

Gleam is available as part of the official packages repository. Install it with:

```
# zypper install gleam
```

### Android

#### Termux

Gleam is available as part of the official packages repository. Install it with:

```sh
pkg install gleam
```

### Windows

#### Using Scoop

With [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) installed on your computer run the following:

```
scoop install gleam
```


### Build from source

The compiler is written in the Rust programming language and so if you wish to
build Gleam from source you will need to [install the Rust
compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```sh
# Download the Gleam source code git repository
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam.git --branch $THE_LATEST_VERSION
cd gleam

# Build the Gleam compiler. This will take some time!
make install

# Verify the compiler is installed
# Prints "gleam $VERSION"
gleam --version
```

## Installing Erlang

Gleam compiles to Erlang code, so Erlang needs to be installed to run Gleam
code. Some of the above package managers (e.g. Homebrew) will install Erlang
alongside Gleam automatically.

Precompiled builds for many popular operating systems can be downloaded from
the [Erlang solutions website](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/resources/download.html).

Once Erlang has been installed you can check it is working by typing `erl
-version` in your computer's terminal. You will see version information like
this if all is well:

```shell
erl -version
Erlang (SMP,ASYNC_THREADS) (BEAM) emulator version 12.1.5
```

### Linux

#### Using Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) will install Erlang alongside Gleam automatically,
though it can be manually installed by running the following:

```sh
brew update
brew install erlang
```

#### Alpine Linux (Community repository)

```shell
apk add erlang
```

#### Arch Linux (Community repository)

```shell
pacman -S erlang
```

#### Gentoo Linux (already installed after installing gleam through emerge)

```shell
emerge --ask dev-lang/erlang
```

#### Fedora

```shell
dnf install elixir erlang
```

#### Debian, Ubuntu

```shell
# Add to /etc/apt/sources.list
deb http://binaries2.erlang-solutions.com/ubuntu/ jammy-esl-erlang-25 contrib
# Possible other lines depending on your `lsb_release -c`
# deb http://binaries2.erlang-solutions.com/debian/ bullseye-elixir-1.15 contrib
# deb http://binaries2.erlang-solutions.com/ubuntu/ bionic-mongooseim-6 contrib

# Add Erlang Solutions repo keys:
wget https://binaries2.erlang-solutions.com/GPG-KEY-pmanager.asc
sudo apt-key add GPG-KEY-pmanager.asc

# Update apt and install esl-erlang
sudo apt update
sudo apt install esl-erlang
```

### macOS

#### Using Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) will install Erlang alongside Gleam automatically,
though it can be manually installed by running the following:

```sh
brew update
brew install erlang
```

#### Using MacPorts

With [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/) installed run the following:

```sh
sudo port install erlang
```

### Windows

#### Using Chocolatey

With [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) installed on your computer run the
following:

```
choco install erlang
```

#### Using Scoop

With [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) installed on your computer run the following:

```
scoop install erlang
```

### Using version managers

#### asdf

The asdf version manager has a plugin for installing Erlang. Installation and
usage instructions can be found here:

- [https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf)
- [https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-erlang)

## Installing rebar3

When using Erlang based dependencies (such as their web servers and HTTP clients)
the rebar3 Erlang build tool may need to be installed.
Install rebar3 by following the [official rebar3 installation
instructions][rebar3-install].

[rebar3-install]: https://rebar3.org/docs/getting-started/

## Editor Plugins

Gleam plugins are available for several popular editors. If one exists for
your editor of choice consider installing it for syntax highlighting and other
niceties.
