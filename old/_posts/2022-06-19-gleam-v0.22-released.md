Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam [v0.22.0][release] has been released, let's
take a look at what's new.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.22.0


## TypeScript declarations

Excellent Interop with other languages on the target runtimes is a core concern
of Gleam. We want to take full advantage of the existing ecosystems, and we also
want to give back to those ecosystems and make Gleam code easy to use from them.

To aid with interop when running on JavaScript runtimes Gleam can now generate
TypeScript declaration files, enabling TypeScript users to have full type
checking when calling code written in Gleam. These definition files will include
accurate definitions for all the types, functions, and constants defined in
Gleam.

This feature can be enabled in your `gleam.toml`.

```toml
name = "my_project"
version = "1.0.0"

[javascript]
typescript_declarations = true
```

With this a `.d.ts` file will be generated for each Gleam module compiled. For
example this Gleam module:

```gleam
pub const answer = 42

pub fn map(result, fun) {
  case result {
    Ok(a) -> Ok(fun(b))
    Error(e) -> Error(e)
  }
}
```

Will produce this `.d.ts` file.

```typescript
import * as _ from "./gleam.d.ts";

export const answer: number;

export function map<A, E, B>(
  result: _.Result<A, E>,
  fun: (x: A) => B,
) => _.Result<B, E>
```

Note that while the Gleam code here doesn't have any type annotations the
TypeScript declaration file still has all the type information. Gleam's type
inference doesn't require annotations, Gleam code is always fully type checked.

Thank you to [E Jikan](https://github.com/vstreame) of VStream for this
feature!


## Multi-variant accessors

Gleam has the `.field_name` syntax found in many languages. With it you can
access values within a custom type by their name.

```gleam
pub type SchoolPerson {
  Teacher(name: String, subject: String)
}

pub fn get_name(person: SchoolPerson) {
  person.name // Using the accessor syntax
}
```

However this was only supported for custom types with a single variant. If a
`Student` variant was added to the above then the accessor syntax would not be
usable.

```gleam
pub type SchoolPerson {
  Teacher(name: String, subject: String)
  Student(name: String, age: Int) // A new variant
}
```

With this release the accessor syntax can be used for fields found in all
variants of a custom type. In this specific example `.name` can be used, but
`.subject` and `.age` cannot as they are defined only in a single variant.

Thank you to [Harry Bairstow](https://github.com/HarryET) for this feature!


## Deployment artefacts

People are starting to run web applications written in Gleam in production. This
is very exciting! To help with this we are focusing on deployment tooling and
documentation, first with the new `gleam export` command.

By running `gleam export erlang-shipment` the compiler will produce a directory
of Erlang bytecode and configuration that can be copied onto a server or into a
container and then run with `./entrypoint.sh run`. Gleam does not need to be
installed on the production server for this to be used, only the virtual machine
is required.


## Automatable package publishing

Gleam integrates with Hex, the package repository for the BEAM ecosystem. From
this release commands that work with Hex can take authentication credentials
from the `HEXPM_USER` and `HEXPM_PASS` environment variables, and auto-accept
confirmation prompts with the `--yes` flag. This makes it possible to do things
such as automatically publish Gleam packages on a CI system or from a build
script.

Thank you to [Robert Attard](https://github.com/TanklesXL) for this feature!

And on a related note, recently published packages can be replaced with `gleam
publish --replace`. This is useful for correcting any mistakes made during the
process of releasing a package. Thank you [Shayan Javani](https://github.com/massivefermion)!


## Better debugging

This release brings the new `string.inspect` function, which will convert any
value to a string in Gleam syntax.

```gleam
string.inspect([1, 2, 3]) // "[1, 2, 3]"
string.inspect(Ok("Hi!")) // "Ok(\"Hi!\")"
string.inspect(Nil)       // "Nil"
```

The `io.debug` function has also been upgraded to use this function, so now
debug printing values will result in Gleam syntax being used rather than the
runtime Erlang representation.

Thank you to [inoas](https://github.com/inoas) for this feature!
