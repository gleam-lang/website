Often people ask "Hey Louis! What's coming next in Gleam?"

It's a tricky question to answer. Gleam is a community project rather than a
corporate one, so often many things are happening at once. As the project leader
I have my own priorities, but it's up to individual contributors to decide what
they find valuable and fun enough to work on. Often the most useful way to
respond is to give an overview of the upcoming features that I think are most
exciting or impactful, and directing them to the changelog and the issue tracker
if they want to learn more.

To help with this, and to give folks a quicker way to access this information
than waiting for me to reply on the Gleam discord server, I've created the
Gleam development roadmap. It lists the most impactful features, past,
present, and future, and I'll update it with each new Gleam release. I hope you
find it useful!
