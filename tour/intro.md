# Introduction

In this page we guide you through the fundamentals of the Gleam language, namely its
syntax, core data structures, flow control features, and static type system.
If you have some prior programming experience this will hopefully be enough
to get you started with Gleam.

In some sections we touch on the runtime representation of various features.
This is useful for programmers with Erlang or Elixir experience who wish to
use Gleam alongside these languages. If you are using Gleam alone this
information can be safely ignored.
