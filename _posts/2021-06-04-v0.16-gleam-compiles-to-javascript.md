Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine, and
as of today's [v0.16.0][release] release Gleam compiles to JavaScript as well!

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.16.0

## Show me!

What's the introduction of a new way to write front end web code without some
cliché examples? 

Here's a collection of interactive widgets you've probably seen countless times
before, along with their Gleam source code and the JavaScript it compiles into.

In the interest of brevity we skip error handling in these examples and use
rather quick-and-dirty type definitions of the JavaScript functions they import.
In real Gleam programs we would expect these JavaScript bindings to live within
shared libraries, but these examples should be enough to give you a taste of
what Gleam can do with JavaScript.

## Why JavaScript?

The Erlang virtual machine is second-to-none for long-running services that run
on servers, but outside of the server space it may not always be the best tool
for the job. It is not supported on all platforms, and factors such as compiled
application size, boot time, and ease of installation may be an issue.

JavaScript is one of the most widely used and widely supported languages in the
world. It can be used for website front ends, desktop applications, command line
applications, mobile phones app, on IoT devices, on cloud serverless platforms,
and more.

While JavaScript lacks the multi-core and distribute computing capabilities of
the Erlang virtual machine it does have robust concurrency features and
respectable single threaded performance thanks to highly optimised runtimes such
Google's V8 engine, which is used in NodeJS and the Chrome web browser.

By compiling to JavaScript as well as Erlang Gleam can be used for a much wider
range of problem spaces and domains, and be accessible to a wider range of
people. A team writing a backend web API in Gleam can now choose to also write
their website frontend in Gleam, sharing code between both platforms and enjoying
the friendly and productive type-based programming style of Gleam throughout
their application stack.

Personally I'm excited to run Gleam code using serverless function platforms
and to make [fun little art sketches](https://lpil.uk/elm-hearts/) that run in
the browser.

## What's ready to use?

## How does concurrency work?

## What does this mean for Erlang?

## What's next?

## Speeding up Gleam development

I am very happy to announce that I am returning to full time Gleam development!
You can expect features and releases to be larger and more frequent over the
coming year, and I cannot wait to share with you what we've got coming next!
This is an exciting time for Gleam.

Gleam sponsorship is now my primary source of income. If you would like to
support me in making Gleam please consider [sponsoring Gleam][sponsor] or asking
your employer to sponsor Gleam. Every donation makes a difference, no matter how
small, so thank you for your help.
