Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam [v0.25.0][release] has been released, featuring
a long-awaited new feature: `use` expressions.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.25.0


## The motivation

Two of Gleam's main goals are to be easy to learn and easy to work with. In aid
of these goals Gleam the language is designed to be as small and consistent as
possible, drawing inspiration from other languages such as Elm, Go, and Lua.

Because of this Gleam lacks exceptions, macros, type classes, early returns, and
a variety of other features, instead going all-in with just
first-class-functions and pattern matching. All flow control in Gleam programs
is explicit and all functionality is built from data being passed to and
returned from functions.

This small set of tools works well for making Gleam code approachable but has
one irritation: indentation. Certain patterns in Gleam result in code with more
indentation than you might get in other languages.

```gleam
pub fn login(credentials) {
  case authenticate(credentials) {
    Error(e) -> Error(e)
    Ok(user) ->
      case fetch_profile(user) {
        Error(e) -> Error(e)
        Ok(profile) -> render_welcome(user, profile)
      }
  }
}
```

To remedy this common problem we introduced the `try` expression in v0.9, which
made it possible to write code that used the `Result` type (Gleam's way of
representing a possible failure) without any indentation. The code above could
be written like so.

```gleam
pub fn login(credentials) {
  try user = authenticate(credentials)
  try profile = fetch_profile(user)
  render_welcome(user, profile)
}
```

This has worked well for us so far as most of the time these patterns of nesting
come from code that works with the `Result` type, however as more applications
are written in Gleam it has become clear that we want to avoid indentation in
other situations as well.

As a concrete example, here is a HTTP request handler written in Python.

```python
def handle_request(request: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse:
    with (
        logger.span("handle_request"),
        database.connection() as conn,
    ):
        if request.method != "POST":
            return method_not_allowed_response()

        try:
            record = database.insert(conn, request.body)
        except InsertError as exc:
            return bad_request_response(exc)
          
        return created_response(record)
```

If this code was replicated in Gleam it might look like this:

```gleam
pub fn handle_request(request: HttpRequest) {
  logger.span("handle_request", fn() {
    database.connection(fn(conn) {
      case request.method {
        Post ->
          case database.insert(conn, request.body) {
            Ok(record) -> created_response(record)
            Error(exc) -> bad_request_response(exc)
          }
        _ -> method_not_allowed_response()
      }
    })
  })
}
```

It is unsatisfying that this code isn't easier to read and more aesthetically
pleasing. Web backends are a good use case for Gleam, and there are plenty of
other domains and types of application that will have similar issue.

After much discussion and research the solution we have come up with is the
new `use` expression. We believe it manages to be expressive and capable enough
to resolve all these problems while being conceptually simple compared to most
other solutions.

Here's what the same Gleam code might look like with `use`:

```gleam
pub fn handle_request(request: HttpRequest) {
  use <- logger.span("handle_request")
  use <- require_method(request, Post)
  use conn <- database.connection()

  case database.insert(conn, request.body) {
    Ok(record) -> created_response(record)
    Error(exc) -> bad_request_response(exc)
  }
}
```

The trade off here is that it is less immediately obvious what `use` does to a
newcomer. We have introduced some additional complexity to the language, but we
think this additional learning requirement is a worthwhile trade for the better
developer experience, and Gleam is still a small language compared to most.

## What does `use` do?

The `use` expression is a bit of syntactic sugar that turns all following
expressions into an anonymous function that gets passed as an additional
argument to a function call.

For example, imagine I had a function called `with_file` which would open a
file, pass the open file to a given function so it can read from or write to it,
and then closes the file afterwards.

```gleam
// Define the function
pub fn with_file(path, handler) {
  let file = open(path)
  handler(file)
  close(file)
}

// Use it
pub fn main() {
  with_file("pokemon.txt", fn(file) {
    write(file, "Oddish\n")
    write(file, "Farfetch'd\n")
  })
}
```

With `use` this function could be called without extra indentation. This example
below with `use` compiles to exactly the same code as the one above.

```gleam
pub fn main() {
  use file <- with_file("pokemon.txt")
  write(file, "Oddish\n")
  write(file, "Farfetch'd\n")
}
```

And it's not just limited to a single argument, functions of any arity can be
used, including functions that accept no arguments at all.

## What can it be used for?

The `use` expression is highly generic and isn't restricted to any particular
types, interfaces, or laws, so it can applied to many different things.

It could be used to create HTTP middleware, as seen in the web service example
above.

```gleam
pub fn require_method(request, method, continue) {
  case request.method == method {
    True -> continue()
    False -> method_not_allowed()
  }
}

pub fn handle_request(request) {
  use <- require_method(request, Post)
  // ...
}
```

It could be used to replicate Go's [defer](https://gobyexample.com/defer)
statements.

```gleam
pub fn defer(cleanup, body) {
  body()
  cleanup()
}

pub fn main() {
  use <- defer(fn() { io.println("Goodbye") })
  io.println("Hello!")
}
```

It could be used to replicate Elixir's
[for comprehensions](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/comprehensions.html)

```gleam
import gleam/list

pub fn main() {
  use letter <- list.flat_map(["a", "b", "c"])
  use number <- list.map([1, 2, 3])
  #(letter, number)
}

// [
//   #("a", 1), #("a", 2), #("a", 3),
//   #("b", 1), #("b", 2), #("b", 3),
//   #("c", 1), #("c", 2), #("c", 3),
// ]
```

Or it be used as a replacement for Gleam's own `try` expression. Here's the same example from above but with `use` rather than `try`.

```gleam
pub fn attempt(result, transformation) {
  case result {
    Ok(x) -> transformation(x)
    Error(y) -> Error(y)
  }
}

pub fn main() {
  use user <- attempt(authenticate(credentials))
  use profile <- attempt(fetch_profile(user))
  render_welcome(user, profile)
}
```

It is a very flexible language feature, I'm looking forward to seeing what
people do with it!

## Prior art and thanks

This feature is largely inspired by Python's `with`, OCaml's `let` operators,
the [trailing lambda pattern](https://gist.github.com/lpil/98589aaca3b09a3c7ce92b4a1b1d521a)
in ML languages. Thank you to those excellent languages, and thank you to
everyone on the [Gleam Discord server](https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy) who helped
figure out how it should work.

After designing this feature we also discovered that similar features can be
found in Koka (`with` expressions) and Roc (back-passing). They are both
excellent languages and we feel we are in great company with them.

Gleam is made possible by the support of all the kind people and companies who have
very generously [**sponsored**](https://github.com/sponsors/lpil) or
contributed to the project. Thank you all!
