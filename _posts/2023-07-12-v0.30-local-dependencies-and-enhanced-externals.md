Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam [v0.30.0][release] has been released, let's
take a look at what's new.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.30.0

## Local dependencies

Gleam's build tool has always had support for Hex, the package repository for the
Erlang ecosystem. It now additionally supports local dependencies, allowing you
to depend on other Gleam projects without pushing them to the repository.

```toml
# gleam.toml
name = "my_project"

[dependencies]
gleam_stdlib = "~> 0.30"
my_other_project = { path = "../my_other_project" }
```

You may want to use local dependencies when testing your project before
publishing, when working on multiple related packages, or to enforce a certain
dependency structure between parts of your codebase, such as ensuring a domain
layer does not depend on a web framework.

One way I will be using this feature is to have a package of shared types and
functions that I can use in both the Gleam Erlang backend and the Gleam
JavaScript frontend of my web applications.

Thank you [Miles Silberling-Cook](https://github.com/NthTensor) for this
feature!


## Enhanced externals

Gleam can without any overhead import and call functions written in other
languages on the runtime, such as Erlang, Elixir, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

If I wanted to define a public function that used FFI (foreign function interface)
to halt the runtime I could do it like this:

```gleam
/// Halt the runtime with the given exit code.
pub fn halt(code: Int) -> Nil {
  native_halt(code)
}

if erlang {
  external fn native_halt(Int) -> Nil =
    "erlang" "halt"
}

if javascript {
  external fn native_halt(Int) -> Nil =
    "./my_javascript_module.mjs" "halt"
}
```

Here a public function with a documentation comment calls a private function,
and conditional compilation is used to define the private function differently
depending on the target runtime.

I think you'll agree that it is quite verbose and repetitive; of the 14 lines of
code in this example only 4 are meaningful.

Conditional compilation gives the programmer little in the way of guidance on
how to structure their code, so other approaches can be found today in published
Gleam packages:

Some packages only support a single target runtime, as such they may omit the
conditional compilation entirely, documenting the supported target in their
README. These packages will not work on other runtimes, and may fail to compile
with a cryptic message.

Other packages omit the non-conditional facade function entirely, instead making
the two conditional functions public. This approach is more concise but without
any link between the two different implementations there can be drift, with
types and functions either intentionally or unintentionally differing.

With Gleam v0.30.0 the FFI has been redesigned to address all these issues. The
above example is now written like this:

```gleam
/// Halt the runtime with the given exit code.
@external(erlang, "erlang", "halt")
@external(javascript, "./my_javascript_module.mjs", "halt")
pub fn halt(code: Int) -> Nil
```

This is much more concise, and the single function header ensures the various
targets are kept in sync.

What's more the compiler can now always infer what targets a function is
implemented for, which in future we can use for dead code elimination and to
show supported targets for packages on [the Gleam package index website](https://packages.gleam.run/).

## Panic! Todo!

Gleam has `todo` and `panic` keywords that can be used to crash the program when
code is reached that is either unfinished or should never be reached. If you
wanted to give a custom message to that crash for `todo` you would have written
it like this:

```gleam
pub fn main() {
  todo("I really need to finish this...")
}
```

This syntax resulted in some confusion where people would think that these
keywords are functions, and try to assign them to values. To make it clearer the
syntax for providing a custom message has been changed to this:

```gleam
pub fn main() {
  todo as "I really need to finish this..."
}
```

This syntax may be extended in future for assertions and other error messages.

## Any order aliases

Previously type aliases could only refer to aliases defined earlier in the same
module. This restriction has been lifted, so this mundane looking code will now
compile.

```gleam
pub type Bill = List(#(String, Euro))

pub type Euro = Int
```

## Build tool improvements

Gleam packages can now specify the minimum version of Gleam required to build them.

```toml
# gleam.toml
name = "my_project"
gleam = ">= 0.30.0"
```

If a user attempts to build a package with a version that doesn't meet the
specified version constraint an error will be emitted.

And lastly, the `gleam remove` command has been added to remove dependencies
from a package, to complement the existing `gleam add` command.

Thank you [Miles Silberling-Cook](https://github.com/NthTensor) and 
[Mateusz Bil](https://github.com/rubytree) for these features!


## Thanks

Gleam is made possible by the support of all the kind people and companies who have
very generously [**sponsored**](https://github.com/sponsors/lpil) or
contributed to the project. Thank you all!

If you like Gleam consider sponsoring or asking your employer to
[sponsor Gleam development](https://github.com/sponsors/lpil). I work full time
on Gleam and your kind sponsorship is how I pay my bills!
