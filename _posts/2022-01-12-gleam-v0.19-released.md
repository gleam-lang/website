Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine (and
JavaScript). Today Gleam [v0.19.0][release] has been released, let's take a look
at what's been added over the last month.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.19.0

## JavaScript support in the build tool

In the v0.18 we released the first version of the Gleam build tool, bringing a
high quality and modern developer experience to Gleam projects. With v0.19 the
build tool has been expanded to support Gleam's JavaScript backend as well as
the primary Erlang backend.

To instruct the build tool to compile to JavaScript add the `target` entry to
your `gleam.toml`.

```toml
name = "my_project"
version = "1.0.0"
target = "javascript" # Compile to JavaScript

[dependencies]
gleam_stdlib = "~> 0.19"
```

If your project is a library that supports both the Erlang and the JavaScript
targets then you may want to select between them on a case by case basis. To
support this workflow the optional `--target` flag has been added to some of the
main `gleam` commands such as `gleam run` and `gleam test`.

```sh
# Run the app on JavaScript
gleam run --target javascript

# Run the tests on Erlang
gleam test --target erlang

# Use the target specified in gleam.toml
gleam run
```

## Erlang package precompilation

Gleam is part of the wider BEAM ecosystem. We benefit greatly from the other
languages such as Erlang and Elixir, and we want to give back to those
languages so they can benefit from Gleam too.  Gleam is designed to be easy to
use from other BEAM languages. There's no overhead compared to calling regular
Erlang code, and the generated APIs are idiomatic Erlang.

Any Gleam packages published to Hex (the BEAM ecosystem package manager) now
includes the project code compiled to Erlang. Once the various build tools of
the other languages have been updated they will be able to depend on packages
written in Gleam without having the Gleam compiler installed.

We want to fit into the wider ecosystem so smoothly that Erlang and Elixir
programmers might not even know they're using Gleam at all! All they need to
know is that the library they are using is rock-solid and doesn't fail on them.

## JSON in Gleam

Up until now if you want to use JSON in your Gleam program you'll have imported
one of the Erlang JSON libraries using Gleam's FFI, but there's been no official
advice on which one to use or what the interface should be.

To resolve this the [`gleam_json`][json] library has been released, which
provides fast, memory efficient, and type safe JSON encoding/decoding without
requiring any native code extensions.

Encoding JSON looks like this:

```gleam
import myapp.{Cat}
import gleam/json.{object, string, array, int, null}

pub fn cat_to_json(cat: Cat) -> String {
  object([
    #("name", string(cat.name)),
    #("lives", int(cat.lives)),
    #("flaws", null()),
    #("nicknames", array(cat.nicknames, of: string)),
  ])
  |> json.to_string
}
```

And decoding JSON into a Gleam data type looks like this:

```gleam
import myapp.{Cat}
import gleam/json.{DecodeError}
import gleam/dynamic.{field, list, int, string}

pub fn cat_from_json(json_string: String) -> Result(Cat, DecodeError) {
  let cat_decoder = dynamic.decode3(
    Cat,
    field("name", of: string),
    field("lives", of: int),
    field("nicknames", of: list(string)),
  )

  json.decode(from: json_string, using: cat_decoder)
}
```

Both of these APIs are type safe and return informative error messages if given
JSON that doesn't conform to the expected format.

### Faster JSON for all BEAM users

In researching which JSON backend to use for Gleam's JSON library we discovered
that the fastest and most memory efficient library was Micha≈Ç Muska≈Ça's
[Jason][jason].

[jason]: https://github.com/michalmuskala/jason

We wanted to use Jason, but unfortunately it was written in Elixir, which makes
it difficult to use without going through the manual process of installing the
Elixir compiler and standard library, as well as configuring your build tool to
build it.

To resolve this issue we've converted Jason from Elixir to Erlang, so that it
can be easily used in projects written in any BEAM language. In benchmarking it
performs just as well as Jason, while also having a smaller compiled bytecode
size.

This new Erlang version has been released as [Thoas][thoas] and is ready to be
used in your Erlang projects, as well as being used as the backend for the Gleam
JSON library.

An extra special thank you to Micha≈Ç Muska≈Ça's work in creating Jason. It's a
very impressive project and without it we would not have been able to make
Gleam's JSON library as good as it is.

## A new decoder API

The above JSON decoding code snippet also shows off the new standard library API
for safely decoding untyped data into well typed Gleam data. In short, it has
been redesigned to be composable and more consise.

Here's a decoder written using the old API.

```gleam
import myapp.{Book}
import gleam/dynamic.{Dynamic, Decoder, typed_list, string, field}

pub fn book_decoder() -> Decoder(Book) {
  fn(data: Dynamic) {
    try title = field(data, "title")
    try title = string(title)
    try published = field(data, "published")
    try published = int(published)
    try authors = field(data, "authors")
    try authors = typed_list(authors, string)
    Ok(Book(title, published, authors))
  }
}
```

And here it is with the new API.

```gleam
import myapp.{Book}
import gleam/dynamic.{Decoder, list, string, field}

pub fn book_decoder() -> Decoder(Book) {
  dynamic.decode3(
    Book,
    field("title", string),
    field("published", int),
    field("authors", list(of: string)),
  )
}
```

I hope you'll agree it's much nicer to look at!

The errors returned when data has the incorrect format have also been improved.
With the new API errors are returned from all the problem fields (rather than
just the first one), and it includes a `path` field which indicates where the
problem value could be found in the input data.

## Gleam üíú Elixir

Often people are interested in Gleam but are not ready to dive in and use it for
everything. Understandable! Gleam is a young language. More often people would
like to continue with their Elixir or Erlang project and some Gleam modules as
it suits them.

To meet this need the [`mix_gleam`][mix_gleam] plugin for Elixir's build tool
has been completely revamped. With it you can add Gleam code and Gleam
dependencies to your Mix project, and integrate with your usual Elixir workflow.

Huge thanks to [Tynan Beatty][tynanbe] for making this happen!

## And the rest

Those are the big new things, but as always there's lots of little improvements.

OTP applications from dependencies will be automatically started for you when
using the Gleam build tool, removing one common source of confusion for people
unfamiliar with Erlang/OTP.

The `compile-package` API has been reworked, making it easier to use the Gleam
compiler from other build tools.

The source code formatter's output format as been improved.

The compiler's code generation tests have been converted to use snapshot
testing, making it much faster and easier to make changes to the code generator.
Thank you [Michael Jones][michaeljones]!

Checksums are now provided for precompiled Gleam binaries. Thank you [Sam][thepratt]!

Lastly, some error messages have been improved and lots of bugs have been fixed.
