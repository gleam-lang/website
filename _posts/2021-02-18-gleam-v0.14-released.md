Hot on the heels of Gleam v0.13 comes another release, [Gleam v0.14][release]!
As always, let's take a look at some of the highlights.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.14.0

## Dialyzer & Erlang typespecs

Many dynamically typed BEAM languages support Erlang's typespecs, type
annotations that can be analysed with the [Dialyzer][dialyzer] tool. While
not as powerful or reliable as Gleam's type system it can be a useful tool
for finding problems with your Erlang or Elixir code. Dialyzer doesn't
require typespecs but it can work better if they are added to the code.

[dialyzer]: https://erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html

Starting with this release Gleam will generate typespecs for all functions
and Erlang type definitions for all declared types within a Gleam program,
giving you one extra tool to help you write robust and reliable code when
using Gleam alongside Elixir or Erlang.

For a quick example, here's some code in Gleam:

```gleam
pub type LinkedList(element) {
  Empty
  Node(element, LinkedList(element))
}

pub fn is_empty(list) {
  list == Empty
}

pub fn map(list, fun) {
  case list {
    Empty -> Empty
    Node(i, list) -> Node(fun(i), map(list, fun))
  }
}
```

And here's the Erlang code and typespecs it compiles to:
 
```erlang
-module(linked_list).
-compile(no_auto_import).

-export([is_empty/1, map/2]).
-export_type([linked_list/1]).

-type linked_list(H) :: empty | {node, H, linked_list(H)}.

-spec is_empty(linked_list(any())) -> boolean().
is_empty(List) ->
    List =:= empty.

-spec map(linked_list(R), fun((R) -> U)) -> linked_list(U).
map(List, Fun) ->
    case List of
        empty ->
            empty;

        {node, I, List@1} ->
            {node, Fun(I), map(List@1, Fun)}
    end.
```
 
No annotations are required at all in your Gleam code to get full typespec
coverage, Gleam's compiler reuses the type information from its powerful type
inference algorithm to determine the correct typespecs.

Thank you [Greg](https://gitlab.com/greggreg) for this brilliant new feature!

## Erlang escripts

Erlang projects are unusual in that typically instead of having a `main`
function as the entrypoint of your application you define a tree of actors to
come online and process items of work while your program is running.

This can be a powerful way to write long-lived services that make use of the
runtime's fault tolerance features, but it does not lend itself well to
short-lived programs such as command line scripts. It can be confusing to
newcomers from other languages too.

For these short lived programs Erlang [escripts][escript] are typically used.
These are lightweight Erlang programs that have a `main` function as an entrypoint.

[escript]: https://erlang.org/doc/man/escript.html

To make it easier to use these from Gleam the `gleam new` command now has an
escript template that can be used to create an escript project without any
further configuration required.

```shell
gleam new my_script --template escript
```

A world class developer experience is a key goal of the Gleam project.
Further tooling improvements are right around the corner!

## Night mode

Gleam has the ability to render [HTML documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/) 
for your code, ready to upload to Hexdocs.

Thanks to [Tynan Beatty](https://github.com/tynanbe) the documentation is
looking better than ever! There's too many improvements to list but the big
one is they now have a night mode! If you're a night owl like me I'm sure you
will enjoy the lower contrast dark tones when doing some late evening coding.

## Better errors, again

At the risk of sounding like a broken record Gleam's error messages have been
improved yet again. Here's an example of one of the improvements:

Before:

```
error: Syntax error
    ┌─ /src/thing.gleam:115:18
    │
115 │ pub fn overlappedBy(compare, a, b) -> Bool {
    │                  ^^ I was not expecting this.

Expected one of: "("
```

Now:

```
error: Syntax error
    ┌─ /src/thing.gleam:115:18
    │
115 │ pub fn overlappedBy(compare, a, b) -> Bool {
    │                  ^^ This is not a valid name.

Hint: Names start with a lowercase letter and contain a-z, 0-9, or _.
Try: overlapped_by
```

Thank you to [Samuel Mercier](https://github.com/samontea) and [Andy
Thompson](https://github.com/pd-andy) for these.

## Static bit string validation

Bit string syntax is a feature that Gleam inherits from Erlang. It provides a
way to declartively and concisely construct and manipulate raw bits of data
through literals and pattern matching.

With this Gleam release we apply further static analysis to bit string
literals and patterns used in Gleam programs to catch invalid or incorrect
code.

Here's an example of one of the errors that may be reported:

```
error: Syntax error
  ┌─ /Users/a/parser_test/src/a.gleam:2:20
  │
2 │   <<1:size(1)-unit(0)>>
  │                    ^ This is not a valid BitString unit value.

Hint: unit must be an integer literal >= 1 and <= 256
See: https://gleam.run/book/tour/bit-strings
```

Thank you [Greg](https://gitlab.com/greggreg) for this bit string safety net.

## Docker images

Up until now [Peter Saxton](https://github.com/CrowdHailer) has been very kindly
building Gleam docker images for use in [Memo](https://sendmemo.app/) and the
wider community.

With this release he has ported his build automation over to the Gleam repo
so we have automation creation of OCI/Docker images built and published
automatically with each release.

We are building these variants:

- `gleam-erlang`: Gleam and the Erlang tooling on Ubuntu Linux
- `gleam-erlang-slim`: Gleam and the Erlang tooling on slim Debian Linux
- `gleam-erlang-alpine`: Gleam and the Erlang tooling on Alpine Linux
- `gleam-elixir`: Gleam and the Elixir tooling on Ubuntu Linux
- `gleam-elixir-slim`: Gleam and the Elixir tooling on slim Debian Linux
- `gleam-elixir-alpine`: Gleam and the Elixir tooling on Alpine Linux

For all the images see the [Gleam image registry][registry]. Thanks Peter!

the details check out the changelog files:
