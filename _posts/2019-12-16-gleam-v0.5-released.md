[Gleam](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam) has reached v0.5! It's quite a bit
larger than any of the previous releases, so let's take a look.


## Labelled arguments

When functions take several arguments it can be difficult for the user to
remember what the arguments are, and what order they are expected in.

To help with this Gleam supports _labelled arguments_, where function
arguments are given an external label in addition to their internal name.

Take this function that replaces sections of a string:

```gleam
pub fn replace(string, pattern, replacement) {
  // ...
}
```

It can be given labels like so.

```gleam
pub fn replace(in string, each pattern, with replacement) {
  // The variables `string`, `pattern`, and `replacement` are in scope here
}
```

These labels can then be used when calling the function.

```gleam
replace(in: "A,B,C", each: ",", with: " ")

// Labelled arguments can be given in any order
replace(each: ",", with: " ", in: "A,B,C")

// Arguments can still be given in a positional fashion
replace("A,B,C", ",", " ")
```

The use of argument labels can allow a function to be called in an expressive,
sentence-like manner, while still providing a function body that is readable
and clear in intent.

One neat thing is that unlike proplist arguments in Erlang or Elixir, Gleam's
labelled arguments are resolved entirely at compile time and have no
performance or memory cost at runtime.


## A more familiar syntax

One bit of common feedback was that the syntax for enums, case expressions,
and blocks felt a little strange or not in keeping with the wider language.

In response to this we have adopted a syntax closer to that found in
C-influenced languages such as ECMAScript.

```gleam
case x {
  1 -> "It's one"
  2 -> "It's two"

  // Braces can be used for multiple statements
  _ -> {
    let number = int.to_string(x)
    string.concat(["I'm not sure what ", number, " is"])
  }
}
```
```gleam
pub enum Cardinal {
  North
  East
  South
  West
}
```


## Multi-subject case

Often it is useful to pattern match on multiple values at the same time.
Previously in Gleam the solution was to wrap the values in a struct and
pattern match on all values at once.

```gleam
case Pair(x, y) {
  Pair(1, 1) -> "both are 1"
  Pair(1, _) -> "x is 1"
  Pair(_, 1) -> "y is 1"
  Pair(_, _) -> "neither are 1"
}
```

To remove some boilerplate here Gleam's case expression now supports pattern
matching on multiple values.

```gleam
case x, y {
  1, 1 -> "both are 1"
  1, _ -> "x is 1"
  _, 1 -> "y is 1"
  _, _ -> "neither are 1"
}
```

Theoretically a case expression can match on up to 16,777,215 values. If you
need to match on more values than this please let me know because _wow_, I
wanna know what your code is doing.


## Record compatibility

Gleam's structs are Erlang tuples at runtime. This is great for performance
and memory usage but makes constructing them from Erlang or Elixir less
straightforward than if they were maps.

To resolve this Gleam's structs now at runtime have a tag atom in their first
position, making them compatible with Erlang records. An Erlang record
definition header file is generated for each struct which can be imported into
an Erlang project or used from Elixir using the [Record](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Record.html)
module.

```gleam
// src/cat.gleam

pub struct Cat {
  name: String
  is_cute: Bool
}

pub fn main() {
  Cat(name: "Nubi", is_cute: True)
}
```

```erlang
%%% src/program.erl

-module(program).
-export([main/0]).

%% Import the Cat record definition
-import("gen/src/cat_Cat.hrl").

%% Use the Cat record
main() ->
    #cat{name = <<"Nubi">>, is_cute = true}.
```

```elixir
# lib/program.ex

defmodule Program do
  # Import the Cat record definition
  require Record
  Record.defrecord(:cat, Record.extract(:cat, from: "gen/src/cat_Cat.hrl"))

  # Use the Cat record
  def main do
    cat(name: "Nubi", is_cute: true)
  end
end
```


## Anonymous structs

One drawback to structs now being Erlang record compatible is that they can no
longer be used to interop with Erlang tuples that do not have a tag atom in
the first position.

Anonymous structs map 1 to 1 onto Erlang tuples can are useful for any
situation where interop with Erlang tuples is required.

```gleam
fn main() {
  struct(10, "hello") // Type is struct(Int, String)
  struct(1, 4.2, [0]) // Type is struct(Int, Float, List(Int))
}
```

Anonymous structs don't need to be declared up front but also don't have names
for their fields, so for clarity prefer named structs for when you have more
than 2 or 3 fields.


## Unqualified imports

Tired of typing module names repeatedly for imported types and values? Well
now you don't have to.

```gleam
import animal/cat.{Cat, stroke}

pub fn main() {
  let kitty = Cat(name: "Nubi", is_cute: True)
  stroke(kitty)
}
```

## Project creation

The terminal command `gleam new` now accepts a `--template` flag to generate
different styles of project. An OTP application template has been added
alongside the existing OTP library template.

```sh
gleam new my_fantastic_application --template app
```

In addition all projects generated by `gleam new` come with the required
configuration for CI on GitHub Actions. Push the project to GitHub and your
code will be automatically compiled and your tests run on every code update.

To enable this we've created two new GitHub Actions for setting up Erlang and
Gleam in your GitHub workflow.

- [gleam-lang/setup-erlang](https://github.com/gleam-lang/setup-erlang)
- [gleam-lang/setup-gleam](https://github.com/gleam-lang/setup-gleam)


## The rest

As per usual, in addition to these features there's been a number of other
improvements to the quality of the error messages, the generated code, and a
smattering of bug fixes. ðŸ˜Š

Gleam can continue to improve.
