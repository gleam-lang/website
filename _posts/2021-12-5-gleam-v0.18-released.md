title: Gleam v0.18 released!

Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine (and
JavaScript). Today Gleam [v0.18.0][release] has been released, which includes
the long awaited Gleam build tool.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.18.0

Up until this point Gleam projects have mostly been using rebar3, the standard
Erlang build tool. While it is a great build tool, rebar3 was not designed with
Gleam in mind, and the ergonomics were sometimes surprising to newcomers, so it
wasn't a perfect fit for the language.

With the new Gleam build tool we have full control of the developer experience
and can focus on making writing Gleam as productive and enjoyable as possible.
We hope you like it!

## Let's take a look

The Gleam build tool is built into the Gleam binary with the compiler. Once you
have downloaded Gleam v0.18.0 you have the build tool, there is nothing else to
install.

As before new projects can be created with the `gleam new` command.

```sh
$ gleam new my_project
# Your Gleam project my_project has been successfully created.
# The project can be compiled and tested by running these commands:
# 
# 	cd my_project
# 	gleam test
```

The generated project looks like this:

```sh
$ tree
# ├── README.md
# ├── gleam.toml
# ├── src
# │   └── my_project.gleam
# └── test
#     └── my_project_test.gleam
```

The `src` directory contains your application code, and the `test` directory
contains your test code.

## Running the project

One aspect of rebar3 that people often found surprising was that the Erlang
shell was the primary way to run your Gleam code. With Gleam v0.18 there's now a
familiar command that you can use instead.

```sh
$ cd my_project
$ gleam run
#   Resolving versions
# Downloading packages
#  Downloaded 2 packages in 0.01s
#   Compiling gleam_stdlib
#   Compiling gleeunit
#   Compiling my_project
#    Compiled in 1.85s
#     Running my_project.main
# Hello from my_project!
```

When the build tool runs it will automatically download and compile any
dependency packages, compile your project, and then run the Erlang virtual
machine to invoke `main` function of your project.

Dependencies are automatically sandboxed per-project, so there's no need for
virtual environments or other tools.

## Testing

By default Gleam projects come preconfigured with gleeunit, a wrapper around
Erlang's test framework EUnit. The tests can be run with this command:

```sh
$ gleam test
#   Compiling my_project
#    Compiled in 0.24s
#     Running my_project_test.main
# .
# Finished in 0.008 seconds
# 1 tests, 0 failures
```

The `gleam test` command works similarly to the `gleam run` command and will
download and compile dependencies as required. Because we had already run `gleam
run` on this project, and the dependency requirements had not changed, Gleam
reused the cached results of the previous run. If a new requirement package is
added or the requirements are changed in some other way Gleam will automatically
determine what new code needs to be built and what can be reused.

While gleeunit is the default test framework, it is not mandatory. You can
replace it with any code of your choosing, including test frameworks written in
other BEAM languages such as Erlang or Elixir.


## Adding dependencies

Gleam projects come with a `gleam.toml` file in which you specify project
metadata, such as the project name, version, and any dependencies.

```toml
# Inside gleam.toml...
name = "my_project"
version = "0.1.0"

[dependencies]
gleam_stdlib = "~> 0.18"

[dev-dependencies]
gleeunit = "~> 0.5"
```

Dependency packages are specified in the `dependencies` section, with packages
that are only required in the tests going in the `dev-dependencies` section.

You can add a new dependency package by editing either of these sections, but
you can also use the `gleam add` command.

```sh
$ gleam add gleam_elli
#   Resolving versions
# Downloading packages
#  Downloaded 5 packages in 0.02s
#       Added gleam_elli v0.5.0
```

Here I've added the `gleam_elli` package. If I wanted to add it to the
`dev-dependencies` section I could have run `gleam add gleam_elli --dev`.

The `gleam_elli` package provides bindings to [Elli][elli], an excellent web
server written in Erlang, using the rebar3 build too. This is no problem for the
Gleam build tool, it can be compiled all the same.

One of Gleam's greatest strengths is that it can use code written in other BEAM
languages, you are not limited to just Gleam. This gives the young Gleam
ecosystem a big leg-up; its older siblings of Erlang and Elixir have a wealth of
libraries ready for us to use.

For a full list of all the packages available see the website of the [Hex
package manager][hex].

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

As mentioned the Gleam build tool uses the existing Hex package manager and it's
ecosystem, rather than building a new one from scratch. We're super grateful to
the Hex team for creating such a fantastic package manager, and for offering us
plenty of advise on both how to use it as well as various tips for creating the
Gleam build tool.

In the build tool we are using the state-of-the-art version resolution algorithm
[pubgrub][pubgrub], which was designed by [Natalie Weizenbaum][nex3] for pub,
the package manager for the Dart language. It's an interesting algorithm, so it
is well worth reading Natalie's post linked above. Thank you Natalie!

Pubgrub is quite a complicated algorithm to implement, but we were able to save
a lot of time by using [the Rust implementation][pubgrub-rs], which
serendipitously was first published while the Gleam build tool was being
developed. Thank you to the maintainers [Matthieu Pizenberg][mpizenberg], [Jacob
Finkelman][Eh2406], [Alex Tokarev][aleksator], et al!

Lastly we would like to thank the creators of our other favourite build tools
from the Rust, PureScript, JavaScript, Go, OCaml, Python, Elixir, and Erlang
ecosystems.  While they may not have contributed directly to Gleam they have
been a big inspiration, showing us what a good build tool should and should not
do.
