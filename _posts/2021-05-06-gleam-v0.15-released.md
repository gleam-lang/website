Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine, and
today [v0.15.0][release] has been released! Let's take a look at some of the
highlights.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.15.0

## More concise tuples

A common bugbear of Gleam developers so far has been that the tuple literal
syntax is rather verbose.

```gleam
pub fn main() -> tuple(Int, Float, String) {
  tuple(1, 2.0, "three")
}
```

After a good deal of discussion on GitHub and on [Discord][discord] we settled
on this new syntax inspired by the ECMAScript TC39 proposal and the tuple syntax
of popular programming languages such as Python, Rust, and Haskell.

[discord]: https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy

```gleam
pub fn main() -> #(Int, Float, String) {
  #(1, 2.0, "three")
}
```

The Gleam compiler will continue to accept both syntaxes for now, with the
`tuple(..)` syntax being removed at a later date. To automatically upgrade your
code to the new syntax run `gleam format` within your project.

Thank you to [Sebastian Porto](https://github.com/sporto) for kicking off the
discussion and suggesting the new syntax, [Marcin Puc](https://github.com/tranzystorek-io)
for implementing the new syntax, and everyone who contributed to the discussion.

## Importable prelude module

Gleam's prelude is where the core data types of Gleam are defined, such as
`Int`, `Result`, and `String`. The contents of the prelude were automatically
imported into every module, and there was no way to import them a second time.

This proved a problem in situations where a module defines a new type or value
constructor with the same name as one of the items from the prelude, as it would
no longer be possible to refer to the prelude one.

```gleam
pub type TuringBool {
  True  // Bool's True being shadowed
  False // Bool's False being shadowed
  Dunno
}

pub fn does_it_halt(program) -> TuringBool {
  Dunno
}

pub fn is_problem_solvable() -> Bool {
  False // Wrong bool type!
}
```

Now with v0.15.0 the prelude module can be imported using the name `gleam`,
enabling qualified use of prelude items.

```gleam
import gleam

// ...

pub fn problem_is_solvable() -> Bool {
  gleam.False // Use the prelude False
}
```

## Making assignments expressions

Assignments in Gleam are now expressions that return the value being assigned.
Previously in Gleam assignments were statements, meaning they did not evaluate
to anything and could not be the final form in a function or a block. This had
two main drawbacks.

The first is an development ergonomics issue. When writing Gleam code it is
often desirable to save as often as possible so that the type checker can inform
you of any mistakes or inconsistencies in the code that has just been written.

```gleam
pub fn main() {
  let x = run(1, 2, 3)
  // And now I've hit save...
}
```

If I write the code above and hit save I might expect the Gleam compiler to tell
me whether I've used the `run` function correctly. Instead it would complain
of a syntax error, leaving me none the wiser as to whether my code is correct
until I add a placeholder value on the next line and hit save again. With this
latest version of Gleam this code will now be accepted and type checked.

This is a minor change but it removes friction from the development workflow for
users with these editing habits, making Gleam friendlier and easier to pick up.
Developer experience is a first class concern of Gleam, Gleam should be as
productive and enjoyable to write as possible.

The next issue is that previously it was not possible to have an assertion as
the final form in a function or block, forcing the user to add a superfluous
dummy value to be returned.

```gleam
/// A function that asserts `segments` is non-empty and
/// starts with a slash.
pub fn assert_valid(segments) {
  assert ["/", ..] = segments
}
```

Typically we prefer to use the `Result` type to safely handle invalid states,
but in some scenarios it is beneficial to take advantage of the Erlang virtual
machine's offensive programming and fault tolerance capabilities by using
assertions like this. For example, when prototyping or writing background batch
processing script.

## Standard library additions

This release contains a lot of new standard library functions, mostly in the
`list` and `iterator` modules.

Lists are Gleam's primary ordered collection type. These new functions have been
added for working with lists:

- `chunk` - for dividing a list into contiguous chunks that share some property.
- `combination_pairs` - for getting the unique pair combinations of the elements
  in a list.
- `combinations` - for getting unique combinations sets of a given size of the
  elements in a list.
- `drop_while` - for removing elements from the front of a list that have some
  property.
- `last` - for getting the final element from a list.
- `map_fold` - for updating each element in a list while carrying from state
  from element to element.
- `reduce` - for combining all elements in a list into a single value. A
  specialisation of `fold` that uses first element in the list as the
  accumulator.
- `scan` - for combining all elements in a list into a single value while
  keeping each intemediate value created.
- `sized_chunk` - for dividing a list into contiguous chunks of a certain size.
- `take_while` - for keeping elements from the front of a list while they have
  some property, discarding the rest.

Iterators are similar to lists, except they are lazily evaluated. This makes
them especially useful for processing dataset too large to load into memory at
once. or to decreasing latency as the start of a collection can be processed
before the rest has loaded.

- `all` - for determining whether all elements in an iterator have some property.
- `any` - for determining whether any elements in an iterator have some property.
- `chunk` - for dividing an iterator into contiguous chunks that share some
  property.
- `drop_while` - for removing elements from the front of an iterator that have some
  property.
- `empty` - for creating an iterator with no elements.
- `index` - for returning each element in an iterator with an index int
  indicating their position in the iterator.
- `interleave` - for combining two iterators so that their elements are yielded
  one at a time, alternating from each iterator.
- `intersperse` - for adding a new element between each element in the iterator.
- `iterate` - for creating a new iterator by calling a function repeatedly on an
  initial value.
- `last` - for getting the final element from an iterator.
- `once` - for creating an iterator that contains a single element given by a
  function.
- `reduce` - for combining all elements in an iterator into a single value. A
  specialisation of `fold` that uses first element in the list as the
  accumulator.
- `scan` - for combining all elements in an iterator into a single value while
  keeping each intemediate value created.
- `single` - for creating an iterator that contains a single element.
- `sized_chunk` - for dividing an iterator into contiguous chunks of a certain
  size.
- `take_while` - for keeping elements from the front of an iterator while they
  have some property, discarding the rest.
- `zip` - for combining two iterators into a single iterator that yields pairs
  of elements.

## Speeding up Gleam development

I am very happy to announce that I am returning to full time Gleam development!
You can expect features and releases to be larger and more frequent over the

This is an exciting time for Gleam.

Gleam sponsorship is now my primary source of income. If you would like to
support me in making Gleam please consider [sponsoring Gleam][sponsor] or asking
your employer to sponsor Gleam. Every donation makes a difference, no matter how
small, so thank you for your help.
