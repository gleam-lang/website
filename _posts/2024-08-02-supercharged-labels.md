Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam [v1.4.0][release] has been published, so let's
go over all that's new.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v1.4.0


## A shorthand syntax for labels

Gleam's labelled arguments are a way to give a parameter a name that can be used
at the call site. These serve as documentation and to make code easier to read and
modify. Here the function `date` takes 3 labelled arguments, `day`, `month`, and
`year`.

```gleam
pub fn main() {
  let day = 11
  let month = October
  let year = 1998
  date(year: year, month: month, day: day)
}
```

It's relatively common in Gleam programs to have this repetition of a label and
a variable with the same name. The new label shorthand means that the variable
name can be omitted if it matches the name of the variable to be supplied. With
this the above would be written like so:

```gleam
pub fn main() {
  let day = 11
  let month = October
  let year = 1998
  date(year:, month:, day:)
}
```

The shorthand can be used for labelled record fields and in pattern matching
too.

```gleam
pub fn get_year(date: Date) -> Year {
  let Date(year:, ..) = date
  year
}
```

## Label shorthand code action

There is also a new language server code-action (an automated code edit you can
trigger in your editor) to convert to the shorthand syntax.

```gleam
// Before
case date {
  Day(day: day, month: month, year: year) -> todo
}
```
```gleam
// After
case date {
  Day(day:, month:, year:) -> todo
}
```

Thank you [Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri) for these features!

## Adding labels action

The second code action in this release is one to automatically add the labels
that a call accepts.

```gleam
// Before
pub fn main() {
  Date()
}
```
```gleam
// After
pub fn main() {
  Date(year: todo, month: todo, day: todo)
}
```

And now the programmer can replace the `todo` expressions with whatever values
are appropriate, and they didn't have to refer to the documentation to remember
what the labels are.
Thanks [Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri) once again!

## Label access completion

And lastly on the label front, [Ameen Radwan](https://github.com/Acepie) has
added support for completion of labelled record fields. 

Type a dot (`.`) after a record and the language server will suggest the fields
you can access on the record, along with their types. Labels will also be
suggested when when writing a function call or record construction that has
labels. 

Completions are now sorted by priority based on why the completion is in the
list. This means that more specific completions like labels and local
definitions will be shown before more broad completions like functions from a
not yet imported module.

Thank you Ameen!

## Signature help

The Gleam language server now implemented _signature help_. This means that when
you're calling a function your editor will display the documentation for the
function as well as highlight which argument you need to supply next.

A picture is worth a thousand words, so presumably a video is a small book.
Here's a demonstration:

<video autoplay loop muted playsinline style="width: 720px; max-width: 100%">
  <source src="/images/news/gleam-v1.4-released/help.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

Thank you [Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri) for this!

## Unmistakable warnings

The Gleam build tool implements incremental compilation, so a module will only
be recompiled if its definition changes. This means that Gleam compile times
stay low even as codebases grow very large.

One problem with the implementation was that if a module emitted a warning
during compilation it would not be printed during future compilation unless
the module was edited, as it would be cached instead. This could result in
people not realising that their project has warnings as nothing was displayed
when they run `gleam build` or `gleam test`.

Warnings are now emitted each time the project is built, ensuring that this
mistake can no longer happen.

And on the topic of warnings, [Damir Vandic](https://github.com/dvic) has
improved our Erlang typespec generation to silence new warnings that were added
to Erlang in version OTP27. Thank you!

## Targeted documentation

`gleam docs build` now takes an optional `--target` flag to specify the target
platform for the generated documentation. This typically is not needed but if
you use the discouraged conditional compilation features then it may be useful
for your project. Thank you [Jiangda Wang](https://github.com/frank-iii)!

## Even more fault tolerance!

Gleam's compiler implements _fault tolerant analysis_. This means that when
there is some error in the code that means it is invalid and cannot be compiled,
the compiler can still continue to analyse the code to the best of its ability,
ignoring the invalid parts. Because of this Gleam language server can have a
good understanding of the code and provide IDE feature even when the codebase is
in an invalid state.

Our language server magician [Ameen Radwan](https://github.com/Acepie) has
continued to improve this capability and now the compiler retains more
information in the presence of record accessor or function call related errors,
giving you a better experience in your text editor.

## Help for a common type definition mistake

This is Gleam's syntax for defining a type named `User` that has a single
constructor also named `User`:

```gleam
pub type User {
  User(name: String)
}
```

This syntax is similar to the class syntax in some object oriented languages
where you define the class and constructors for the class for it within it.

One common mistake is to try and use a C-style struct definition syntax in
Gleam, but this syntax is invalid.

```gleam
pub type User {
  name: String
}
```

If you do this then the compile will now emit a custom error that show you what
the correct syntax is and how to fix the problem:

```
error: Syntax error
  ┌─ /src/parse/error.gleam:3:5
  │
3 │     name: String,
  │     ^^^^ I was not expecting this

Each custom type variant must have a constructor:

pub type User {
  User(
    name: String,
  )
}
```

Thank you [Rahul D. Ghosal](https://github.com/rdghosal) for this feature!

A similar improved error message is emitted for when trying to use a function in
a guard expression, while due to its Erlang heritage only a constant-time subset
of pure expressions are permitted in guards. Thank you [Thomas](https://github.com/DeviousStoat)!

## Constant concatenation

The `<>` string concatenation operator can now be used in constant expressions.

```gleam
pub const greeting = "Hello"

pub const name = "Joe"

pub const sentence = greeting <> " " <> name <> "!"
```

Thank you again [Thomas](https://github.com/DeviousStoat)!

## More JavaScript bit array support

Gleam has a literal syntax for constructing and pattern matching on bit
arrays, providing a convenient and easier to understand alternative using
bitwise operations, as is common in other languages. Currently not all options
supported on the Erlang target are supported on the JavaScript target.

In this release [Richard Viney](https://github.com/richard-viney) has added
support for the `little` and `big` endianness options, the `signed` and
`unsigned` int options, 32-bit and 64-bit sized float options, and `utf8`
option. Thank you Richard!

## Document symbols

The language server now supports listing document symbols, such as functions
and constants, for the current Gleam file. You may use this in your editor to
help you get a high-level overview of a module, or to help you navigate around a
large file. This was added by [PgBiel](https://github.com/PgBiel), thank you!

## Case correction

Gleam uses `snake_case` for variables and functions, and `PascalCase` for types
and record constructors. Using a different case is a compile error, so you'll
never have an argument about which case to use in Gleam!

In the event you accidentally use the wrong one the language server now suggests
a code a action to automatically adjust the case to be correct.

```gleam
// Before
let myNumber = 10
```
```gleam
// After
let my_number = 10
```

Thank you [Surya Rose](https://github.com/gearsdatapacks) for this feature!

## Assert to case

The final code action, also from [Surya Rose](https://github.com/gearsdatapacks)
is one to convert a `let assert` expression into a semantically equivalent
`case` and `panic` expression.

```gleam
// Before
let assert Ok(value) = get_result()
```
```gleam
// After
let value = case get_result() {
  Ok(value) -> value
  _ -> panic
}
```

Thank you Surya!

# A call for support

Gleam has no corporate backing and is entirely supported by individuals, most of
which contributing between $5 and $20 USD per month. I am fantastically grateful
for your support, thank you so much.

I currently earn 32% the median salary tech lead salary for the UK,
substantially less than I earned before I dedicated all my time to Gleam.

If you appreciate Gleam, please [support the project on GitHub
Sponsors][sponsor] with any amount you comfortably can.
