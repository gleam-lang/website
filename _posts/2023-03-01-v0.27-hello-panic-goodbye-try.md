Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam [v0.27.0][release] has been released, let's
take a look at what's new.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.27.0

## Using patterns in use expressions

The [Gleam v0.25 release](/news/v0.25-introducing-use-expressions/)
introduced the `use` expression, a feature that helps avoid "callback hell" in
Gleam programs. It is quite powerful and can be used to emulate many features
found in other languages such as early returns, list comprehensions,
async/await, monadic do syntax, and more!

```gleam
pub fn handle(req: Request) -> Response {
  // Return an error for non-post requests
  use <- when(req.method != Post, return: method_not_allowed)

  // Parse the request body or return an error
  use json <- require_json_body(req)

  // Open a database connection, closing it when we're done
  use conn <- database.with_connection

  case database.insert(conn, json) {
    Ok(record) -> created_response(record)
    Error(err) -> bad_request_response(err)
  }
}
```

One limitation of the `use` expression was that patterns could not be used with
their assignments, only bare variables. This means you could not destructure a
tuple or other data structure with them.

As of this release patterns are now supported in the `use` expression, for all your destructuring needs!

```gleam
use #(first, second) <- some_tuple_function()
```


## Don't Panic!

This release introduces the `panic` keyword, a simple little keyword that causes
the program to crash. Why would you want to do this?

Your program may not have sufficiently constrainted types to make invalid state
unrepresentable. In this case you may want to use `panic` to crash the program
when an invalid state is reached, which is often preferable than silently
continuing or programming defensively.

Alternatively you may be embracing the Erlang philosophy of "let it crash" and
choosing to use handle unexpected exceptional errors with an Erlang style
supervision tree. This strategy is particularly effective when rapidly
prototyping or in situations where there is no way to reasonably recover from an
error, or client to show an error message to.

```gleam
case this_should_never_fail() {
  Ok(value) -> continue(value)

  // Oh no! Something went horribly wrong!
  Error(_) -> panic
}
```

Panic is similar to the `assert` keyword, only it always crashes rather than
conditionally. Speaking of the `assert` keyword...

## Towards a better assert

Gleam's `assert` keyword is used to ensure that data matches a given pattern,
crashing the program if it does not. This is useful, but using `assert` for this
functionality means that we can't have an `assert` feature that works with boolean expressions, as is commonly found in other languages.

To remedy this the pattern matching feature has been moved to this `let assert`
syntax. The existing `assert` keyword has been deprecated and will later be used
for a more conventional assertion feature, to be part of a larger Gleam
milestone based around improving the ergonomics of testing Gleam code.

```gleam
let assert Ok(value) = this_should_never_fail()
```

Deprecations are annoying, and nobody likes having to fix their code, so the
Gleam tooling will automatically upgrade your syntax when you run `gleam format`
or format the code in your editor.

## Moving beyond try

`try` expressions were introduced way back in v0.9 as a way of avoiding callback
hell when working with functions that can either return a value or an error. Now
that we have `use` expressions, the less general `try` expressions are redundant.
We always prefer to have fewer ways to do the same thing in Gleam, and fewer
things to have to learn, so `try` expressions are deprecated in this release.

A `try` expression can be replaced by a `use` expression with the `then`
function from the `gleam/result` module. Once `try` is no longer a keyword the
`then` function will be aliased to `try`.

```gleam
// With try
try file = open_file()

// With use
use file <- then(open_file())

// After `try` is removed
use file <- try(open_file())
```

This is still annoying to fix by hand, so the new `gleam fix` command has been
created to automatically upgrade your code for you.

And that's it! There's also lots of other small improvements and bug fixes, so
check the full [release notes][release] for more details.
