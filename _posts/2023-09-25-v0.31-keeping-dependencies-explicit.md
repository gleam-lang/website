Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam [v0.31.0][release] has been released, let's
take a look at what's new.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.31.0

## Requiring explicit dependencies

A Gleam application's dependency graph contains no duplicate packages, each
package has exactly one version.

```
   Application
        │
        ▼
    library_a 
        │
        ▼
    library_b
```

Here the application has specified `library_a` as a dependency in its
`gleam.toml`, and `library_a` has specified `library_b` as a dependency in its
own `gleam.toml`.

As there's no ambiguity as to what version to use Gleam has historically allowed
importing modules from packages that you don't directly depend upon. The
application could happily import modules from `library_b`.

Over time it we have learnt that this form of indirect dependency is unclear
and confusing to a lot of folks, so we're moving to making dependencies explicit
and only permitting imports from direct dependencies.

With this release Gleam will now emit a warning when importing modules from a
package your application does not directly depend upon, and in future versions
of Gleam this will become an error.

```text
warning: Transative dependency imported
  ┌─ src/app.gleam:2:1
  │
2 │ import mist
  │ ^^^^^^^^^^^

The module `mist` is being imported, but `mist`, the package it belongs to,
is not a direct dependency of your package.
In a future version of Gleam this may become a compile error.

Run this command to add it to your dependencies:

    gleam add mist
```

## Marking functions as deprecated

The `@deprecated("...")` attribute has been added to allow marking functions as
deprecated.

If a deprecated function is used Gleam will emit a warning during compliation,
informing the programmer that they need to update their code.

```gleam
pub fn main() {
  deprecated_function()
}

@deprecated("This function is not good! Use `new_function` instead, it is better.")
fn deprecated_function() {
  // Inset implemenation here...
}
```

```text
warning: Deprecated value used
  ┌─ /Users/louis/Desktop/thingy/src/thingy.gleam:2:3
  │
2 │   deprecated_function()
  │   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ This value has been deprecated

It was deprecated with this message: This function is not good! Use
`new_function` instead, it is better.
```


## Quality of life improvements

As we're now ramping up to version 1.0 we're making lots of small improvements
to the ergonomics of the language.

The record access syntax (`person.name`) can now be used in case clause guard
expressions.

```gleam
pub fn listed(names: List(String), person: Person) -> String {
  case names {
    [name, ..names] if name == person.name -> True
    [_, ..names] -> listed(names, person)
    [] -> False
  }
}
```

The `as` keyword can now be used to assign the prefix of a string to a variable when pattern matching.

```gleam
pub fn parse_tag(tag: String) -> Result(Tag, Nil) {
  case tag {
    "category " as key <> value
    | "region " as key <> value
    | "priority " as key <> value -> {
      let key = string.trim(key)
      Ok(Tag(key, value))
    }
    _ -> Error(Nil)
  }
}
```

And the standard library `gleam/int` module now has a series of functions for
performing bitwise operations.

```gleam
int.bitwise_and(9, 3)
// -> 1

int.bitwise_or(9, 3)
// -> 11

int.bitwise_exclusive_or(9, 3)
// -> 10

int.bitwise_not(2)
// -> -3

int.bitwise_shift_left(1, 2)
// -> 4

int.bitwise_shift_right(1, 2)
// -> 0
```

## Wisp

Gleam has been used to make backend web applications for a good few years, but
without a helpful web framework the programmer has to feel comfortable piecing
together various packages to build their application.

Most folks are not so interested in the nitty-gritty of how to put together a
web application and want to focus on the business logic of their application, so
the Wisp framework has been created to help folks get on with solving problems
with Gleam.

Wisp takes the lessons learnt from various existing Gleam web applications and
web frameworks in other languages, and provides a practical, type safe, and
magic-free experience for building web applications. A Wisp request handler
looks a like this:

```gleam
import gleam/result.{try}
import my_app/people
import my_app/web.{Context}
import wisp.{Request, Response}

pub fn handle_request(req: Request, ctx: Context) -> Response {
  use json <- wisp.require_json(req)

  let result = {
    use params <- try(people.parse_params(json))
    use person <- try(people.save(params, ctx.db))
    Ok(people.to_json(person))
  }

  case result {
    Ok(body) -> wisp.json_response(body, 201)
    Error(_) -> wisp.bad_request()
  }
}
```

Today Wisp has a small feature set similar to that of Ruby's Sinatra or Python's
Flask, but it is expected to grow over time to include more features as the
maintainers and community decides what is useful and how they should work.

Wisp is not a Gleam-core project like the compiler or the standard library, but
I (Louis Pilfold, Gleam's creator) am the primary maintainer of Wisp, and the
framework has been designed with the help of prominent members of the Gleam
community.
