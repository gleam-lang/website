It's a new year and there's a new [Gleam release][release]! Let's take a look
at what this one brings.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.13.0

## Gotta go fast

The compiler was no slouch but with this new version it's faster than ever
thanks to improvements to the Gleam and Erlang code generators, as well as a
full rewrite of the parser by [Greg](https://gitlab.com/greggreg).

With these changes compiling Gleam code is 1.8 times faster, and formatting
Gleam code is a super nimble 4.6 times faster! On my machine Gleam compiling
the standard library now takes ~170ms, and formatting all the files takes ~70ms.

This is only the start. Gleam compilation is currently single threaded and
doesn't make use of any caching, so there's lots of opportunities to make big
performance improvements in future.

## Even better errors

Greg's parser rewrite wasn't just about performance, it also greatly improved
the error messages caused by syntax errors. Here are some examples to click through:

## Type safe division

Division is a tricky problem thanks to the number zero. In mathematics the
result of dividing any non-zero number by zero is undefined, making it is a
question with no answer.

Sadly as programmers we can't leave it undefined, have to do something. At
some point some code will be written that divides by zero, so what should the
language do when that happens? There are largely three options:

1. Throw an exception
2. Return `Infinity`
3. Return zero

Throwing an exception is the approach taken by Erlang and other BEAM
languages, and historically this is the approach taken by Gleam. However,
there is a problem.

Gleam aims to be an exception free language, and the `assert` keyword is
intended as being the only way to crash a process. Errors should be
represented by the type system, so it is not in keeping with the design and
goals of the language for division to sometimes crash when dividing numbers.

Languages such as JavaScript that follow IEEE 754 return an `Infinity` value
when dividing by zero, which may be positive or negative. This is a familiar
solution to many programmers, and it fits well with Gleam's "never implicitly
crash" goal.

Unfortunately there is no `Infinity` value on the Erlang virtual so Gleam
would have to implement this. While possible this would cause problems with
Erlang and Elixir interop- we could no longer safely pass Gleam numbers to
Erlang functions as they may be this special `Infinity` value, which would
likely cause a crash. The same problem would occur when calling Gleam code
from Erlang or Elixir, resulting in adding Gleam libraries to your Erlang or
Elixir application being less appealling.

The last option is to follow in the footsteps of languages such as Pony,
Isabelle, Lean and Coq and return zero. This might seem strange at first, but
it is type safe, allows us to maintain good interop with other BEAM
languages, and is representable on any other platform we might target in
future.

In Gleam dividing by zero returns zero!

```rust
1337 / 0 // => 0
```

## Improved documentation

Gleam has the ability to render [HTML
documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/) for your code, ready to
upload to Hexdocs.

Thanks to [Michael Jones](https://github.com/michaeljones) documentation for
functions and types can automatically insert links to GitHub, GitLab, or
BitBucket so you can quickly see how they are implemented.

![A screenshot of Gleam's rendered docs showing a link to source code](/img/gleam-0-13-docs-link.jpg)

Let us know if you use another source code hosts and would like support added too.

Following up from that [Michał Łępicki](https://github.com/michallepicki)
added a version selector so that you can quickly find the documentation for
the version of the library you are using. This dropdown is integrated with
Hexdocs so it will display all versions of the library, rather than just
earlier ones.

## Other stuff

These are just some of the highlights, but there's plenty more improvements
made to the compiler and the standard library since the last release. For all
the details check out the changelog files:

- [Gleam's changelog](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
- [Gleam stdlib's changelog](https://github.com/gleam-lang/stdlib/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
