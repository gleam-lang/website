Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Unlike most programming languages, Gleam does not come from
any particular tech corporation or academic institution; Instead it is a truly
open-source community project and is funded entirely by sponsors, both
individuals and corporations.

Today we welcome and thank [Lambda](https://lambdaclass.com/), Gleam's new primary sponsor.

Lambda operates in a wide array of fields, from machine learning, to distributed
systems, crypto infrastructure, video games, animation, and more. They
often use other BEAM languages such as Elixir and Erlang, as well as well-typed
languages such as Rust, and now they are expanding their technology stack to
include Gleam.

Lambda has a broad portfolio of impactful open-source projects, such as
[lambdaworks](https://github.com/lambdaclass/lambdaworks), a collection of
efficient cryptographic primitives for proving systems;
[Cairo-VM](https://github.com/lambdaclass/cairo-vm), the Rust-based virtual
machine for the Cairo language; and
[Erlings](https://github.com/lambdaclass/erlings), a resourceful guide for
mastering Erlang from the basics to advanced topics.

One of their latest exciting projects is the upcoming mobile game Champions of
Mirra, a fast-paced multiplayer mobile game launching soon in Argentina.

The game program that runs on your phone is made using the popular Unity game
engine. Being a competitive multiplayer game, they needed to pair this game
program with a backend that is reliable, scalable, and perhaps most importantly
low latency, making it a perfect fit for the Erlang virtual machine.

The current version of the backend has recently been published as open-source
software which can be [viewed on GitHub](https://github.com/lambdaclass/mirra_backend), 
and Lambda intends to use Gleam for future iterations of the backend, gaining
both the reliable performance and resilience of the virtual machine, and the
practical and precise development experience of Gleam and its strong static
types.

Lambda's work isn't limited to only software development! They are also working
on the groundbreaking cyberpunk anime _Electro Andes_, set to release next year.

Lambda's investment in Gleam, both financially and in making it part of their
technology stack, is a testament to the Gleam ecosystem and a real milestone for
us. We hope that Lambda inspires other groups, encouraging them to take
advantage of what Gleam has to offer, and to follow their lead in supporting the
ecosystems they are part of.

Thank you Lambda, we're excited to see where this partnership goes and what
innovative Gleam-powered technologies emerge. Especially cool stuff like games
and anime!
