Merry Christmas! Following in the Ruby tradition we're having a release on
Christmas day, and so [Gleam](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam) v0.6 is here!

This release has one big change to how we define data structures in Gleam. To
understand it lets take a look at how structs and enums have worked up until
this point.

```gleam
struct Cat {
  name: String
  age: Int
}
```

Structs are collections of named values. Under the hood they are represented
as Erlang tuples, so `Cat("Nubi", 2)` would be `{<<"Nubi">>, 2}` in Erlang.

```gleam
enum SchoolPerson {
  Teacher(String, Subject)
  Student(String)
}
```

Enum are also collections of values, only this time the values are not named.
One way in which enums are more capable than structs is that they can have
more than one constructor, so for example a SchoolPerson enum type can be
either a Teacher or a Student.

Like structs enums are tuples at runtime, only they have their constructor
name as the first element to help distinguish them, so `Student("Louis")`
would be `{student, <<"Louis">>}` in Erlang. This atom tag makes enums
compatible with Erlang records, allowing easier use within projects written in
Erlang or Elixir.

So the differences between structs and enums were:

1. Struct fields can have names.
2. Enums are Erlang record compatible.
3. Enums can have more than one constructor.

In v0.5 things changed a little.

It turned out that being able to label fields so they have names was useful,
so enums gained labelled arguments (as did functions).

It turns out that being Erlang record compatible with a tag atom was useful
for Erlang interop and for runtime debugging, so structs got this too.

At which point the only difference between enums and structs are the number of
constructors, and there's nothing stopping someone from defining an enum with
a single constructor.

Structs became a subset of enums, so why have both?


## Custom types

With v0.6 rather than structs and enums we have _custom types_. Here's how the
two examples above would be written using the new syntax:

```gleam
type Cat {
  Cat(name: String, age: Int)
}
```
Cat is a custom type has a single constructor called Cat.

```gleam
type SchoolPerson {
  Teacher(name: String, class: Subject)
  Student(name: String)
}
```

SchoolPerson is a custom type has a Teacher constructor and a Student constructor.

```gleam
let louis = Student(name: "Louis")
```

In keeping with Erlang and Elixir an instance of one of these custom types is
called a record. The variable `louis` is a Student record, and it has the type
SchoolPerson.

This change makes the languages simpler (both to the user and within the
compiler), and hopefully it'll make Gleam a little easier to learn too. :)


## Tuples

After this change `struct` is no longer a keyword, and it doesn't make much
sense to have a concept of anonymous structs without named structs, so
anonymous structs have been renamed _tuples_.

```gleam
let pair = tuple(1, "two")
```


## The rest

There's been a number a smattering of bug fixes in this release, see the
[changelog](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for
further details.
