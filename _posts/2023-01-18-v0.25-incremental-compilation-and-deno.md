Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam [v0.26.0][release] has been released, let's
take a look at what's new.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.26.0


## Incremental compilation

A Gleam project is made of packages, typically a top level package and several
dependency packages fetched by the package manager, and each package contains a
collection of modules of Gleam code.

In the very early days of Gleam when the compiler was run it would compile from
scratch every module in every package in the project. This was highly wasteful,
especially for the dependency packages which are would not have changed at all.
To tackle this inefficiency when the Gleam build tool was created it was made to
compile dependency packages only once and reuse the compiled code for every
following build, resulting in only the top level package being recompiled.

This has worked well for the last couple years, but now as more people are using
Gleam it was time for an upgrade. Large projects such as those with a large
amount of generated gRPC code were starting to take an irksome amount of time to
compile. Gleam is all about fun and productivity, so this just won't do!

There are numerous ways we want to improve the performance of the (already very
nimble) Gleam compiler, but the majority of the time is spent in the Erlang
compiler, which we use to generate BEAM bytecode, so these improvements will not
be very impactful here. Instead we need to improve the build tool such that it
only compiles modules when it has to, rather than the entire package.


### How does it work?

When the compiler runs for each module it emits a set of reusable artefacts:
1. Erlang bytecode in a `.beam` file.
2. Erlang record definitions in `.hrl` files for use by any native Erlang modules.
3. Information on the types and values in the module in a `.cache` file.
4. Information the compilation of the module in a `.cache_meta` file.

If the module doesn't need to be compiled again then we can load the `.beam`
bytecode into the virtual machine, load the module information from the `.cache`
file so we can compile other modules that depend on it, and move on to the next
module.

How do we tell if a module needs to be recomplied? There are two checks we need
to make, both using information stored in the `.cache_meta` file.

The first is to check the modification time of the source file against the
compile time stored in the `.cache_meta` file. If the source file modification
time is newer then it has been changed and we need to recompile it.

The second is to look at the modules dependencies. The `.cache_meta` file stores
a list of the modules the the module imports, and using this we can tell if any
of modules upstream in the dependency tree are going to be recompiled. If so
then we need to recompile the module as a change in a dependency may mean that
this module needs to be compiled differently than last time.

### What's next?

These changes have made a huge difference to compilation speed, but there's
still a lot more easy wins we can apply in future here if the need arises.

1. We can check staleness using file hashes as well as modification times to
   avoid excess work when changing git branches or downloading new dependency
   versions.
2. We can use semantic hashing to avoid recompiling modules that have only
   changed in ways that don't affect the generated code, such as changes in
   documentation or comments.
3. We can be more precise when determining whether a change in a dependency
   requires a module to be recompiled. Certain changes won't impact how
   dependent modules compile so if we identify them we can avoid recompiling
   whole sub-trees of the import graph.
4. Several of the Gleam compiler's intermediate representation data structures
   are suitable for optimising to improve their compactness and to greatly
   reduce the number of allocations in the Gleam compiler when constructing
   them.
5. We could use multiple threads. That's right, we've not even bothered to use
   multiple threads in the compile yet!

Developer experience is a top priority for Gleam. You need your feedback as
quickly as possible when writing Gleam code, so we're committed to keeping the
compiler super speedy.

## Deno!


## Prior art and thanks

This feature is largely inspired by Python's `with`, OCaml's `let` operators,
the [trailing lambda pattern](https://gist.github.com/lpil/98589aaca3b09a3c7ce92b4a1b1d521a)
in ML languages. Thank you to those excellent languages, and thank you to
everyone on the [Gleam Discord server](https://discord.gg/Fm8Pwmy) who helped
figure out how it should work.

After designing this feature we also discovered that similar features can be
found in Koka (`with` expressions) and Roc (back-passing). They are both
excellent languages and we feel we are in great company with them.

Gleam is made possible by the support of all the kind people and companies who have
very generously [**sponsored**](https://github.com/sponsors/lpil) or
contributed to the project. Thank you all!
