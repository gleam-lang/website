Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine, and
as of today's [v0.16.0][release] release Gleam compiles to JavaScript as well!

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.16.0

## Show me!

What's the introduction of a new way to write front end web code without some
cliché examples? 

Here's a collection of interactive widgets you've probably seen countless times
before, along with their Gleam source code and the JavaScript it compiles into.

In the interest of brevity we skip error handling in these examples and use
rather quick-and-dirty type definitions of the JavaScript functions they import.
In real Gleam programs we would expect these JavaScript bindings to live within
shared libraries, but these examples should be enough to give you a taste of
what Gleam can do with JavaScript.

## Why JavaScript?

The Erlang virtual machine is second-to-none for long-running services that run
on servers, but outside of this space it may not always be the best tool
for the job. It is not supported on all platforms, and factors such as compiled
application size, boot time, and ease of installation may be an issue.

JavaScript is one of the most widely used and widely supported languages in the
world. It can be used for website front ends, desktop applications, command line
applications, mobile phones app, on IoT devices, on cloud serverless platforms,
and more.

While JavaScript lacks the multi-core and distribute computing capabilities of
the Erlang virtual machine it does have robust concurrency features and
respectable single threaded performance thanks to highly optimised runtimes such
Google's V8 engine, which is used in NodeJS and the Chrome web browser.

By compiling to JavaScript as well as Erlang Gleam can be used for a much wider
range of problem spaces and domains, and be accessible to a wider range of
people. A team writing a backend web API in Gleam can now choose to also write
their website frontend in Gleam, sharing code between both platforms and enjoying
the friendly and productive type-based programming style of Gleam throughout
their application stack.

Personally I'm excited to run Gleam code using serverless function platforms,
and to make [fun little Processing style sketches](https://lpil.uk/elm-hearts/)
that run in the browser.

## How does it work?

Much like the Erlang compiler backend this new JavaScript backend outputs human
readable and pretty printed source code. It is now included with the compiler
and does not require any extra components to be installed to use it.

Rather than attempting to replicate a subset of Erlang's actor model Gleam uses
the standard promise based concurrency model when targeting JavaScript. While
this may be disappointing for some, it means that there is no additional runtime
code added. This keeps bundle size small and makes it so code written in Gleam
can be called like normal from languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript.

## What's next?

### Full language support

The JavaScript backend supports almost all of the Gleam language, but there's a
few features still to be implemented, most notably the bit string syntax.
Support for the remaining features will be added in following releases.

### Tooling

When compiling to Erlang we typically use Erlang's rebar3 build tool or Elixir's
mix build tool. With JavaScript we do not yet any build tool integration and
instead have to use the lower level `gleam compile-package --target=javascript`
command line API. This API could be called by an npm preprocess script, a
makefile, or by more sophisticated integrations with tools such as Parcel or
Webpack.

Currently a Gleam build tool is being worked on, one that will be suitable for
use with Erlang and JavaScript, and handle the resolution and compilation of
dependancies from the Hex package manager. 

### Concurrency exploration

In JavaScript code yield points have to be manually inserted using
`Promise.prototype.then`, or with the `await` keyword, while in languages like
Erlang and Go this is handled automatically by the compiler.

The pervasive `Promise` type and the split between synchronous and asynchronous
functions in JavaScript can be more difficult to learn and use than languages
such as Erlang and Go that make no such distinction.  While there are no firm
plans at present I would like to explore using the Gleam compiler's static
analysis to automatically insert `await` statements into the generated
JavaScript code.

If this proves to be successful and useful we could swap promise based Gleam
code that looks like this:

```gleam
pub fn main() -> Promise(Int) {
  async_function()
  |> promise.then(fn(x) {
    let y = sync_function()
    async_function()
    |> promise.then(fn(z) {
      promise.resolve(x + y + z)
    })
  })
}
```

For automatically yielding Gleam code that looks like this:

```gleam
pub fn main() -> Int {
  let x = async_function()
  let y = sync_function()
  let z = async_function()
  x + y + z
}
```

Both of these examples would have the same runtime behaviour and performance
characteristics.

This would also solve the problem of JavaScript's promise type automatically
flattening `Promise(Promise(value))` into `Promise(value)`, which makes it not
possible to soundly type without adding a special case to Gleam's type system.

## How can I try it?

Instructions on how to install the latest version of Gleam can be found on the
[getting started page][getting-started] of the website. 

Once installed [this Gleam JavaScript template][js-template] can be used for
writing and running Gleam code on JavaScript.

## Thank you

The JavaScript backend for the Gleam compiler was initially created by 
[Peter Saxton](https://github.com/CrowdHailer), so a big thank you to him. I
also want to thank [Andy Thompson](https://github.com/pd-andy), her knowledge of
other functional languages that compile to JavaScript has been invaluable in
getting to this first release.

Gleam is made possible by the support of all the people who have
[sponsored](https://github.com/sponsors/lpil) and contributed to the project.
Thank you all!
