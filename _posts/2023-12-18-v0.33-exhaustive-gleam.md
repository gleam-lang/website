Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam [v0.33.0][release] has been published, a
release that contains some features we in the community have been looking
forward to for a long time! Let's take a look.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.33.0


## Exhaustive exhaustiveness checking

Gleam is designed to make writing and running production software less
stressful. One way it does this is by preventing runtime errors that would have
you scrambling to fix bugs in the middle of the night. If you don't use
assertions then Gleam code will never throw an exception, outside of hardware
problems such as memory exhaustion.

Or that was the idea. There was one place where Gleam was not living up to this
promise: pattern matching.

Pattern matching with a case expression is how flow control is done in Gleam. A
series of clauses are written, and the first clause with a pattern that matches
the input gets run. It's similar to a switch statement in other languages, but
with some extra functionality.

```gleam
pub fn describe(list: List(t)) -> String {
  case list {
    [] -> "Empty list"
    [_] -> "Singleton list"
    [_, _] -> "Two element list"
    _ -> "Long list"
  }
}
```

If no pattern matches the input then a runtime error is thrown. This is not what
we want! To prevent this the Gleam compiler implements _exhaustiveness
checking_. If there are missing patterns then it will emit an error at compile
time, prompting the programmer to fix the code.

Unfortunately the implementation of exhaustiveness checking was, perhaps
amusingly, inexhaustive. It did not work for more complex patterns.

With this release Gleam implements the algorithm described in the paper
[How to compile pattern matching][1] by Jules Jacobs, with help from Yorick
Peterse and his [Pattern matching in Rust][2] project, and as such it will now
catch all missing patterns. Thank you Jules and Yorick!

## Prettier printing

Gleam has a code formatter that will reformat your code to the canonical Gleam
style, saving the keypresses you'd spend formatting your code, and freeing you
from debates about exactly where to put those curly braces.

The formatter implements the algorithm described in the paper
[Strictly Pretty][3] by Christian Lindig. We've been very happy with it, but
there was a few places in which the format we supported was not exactly what we
wanted.

[3]: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2629249_Strictly_Pretty

```gleam
let discounts =
  list.map(
    checkout_line_items,
    fn(item) { calculate_discount(item, discount_codes) },
  )
```

With this release the formatter has gained the "next break fits" extension found
in [Elixir's pretty printer][4], which we now use to format the above code like so:

```gleam
let discounts =
  list.map(checkout_line_items, fn(item) {
    calculate_discount(item, discount_codes)
  })
```

This new format is especially impactful for code with sophisticated DSLs, such
as the web application framework [Lustre][5].

[5]: https://github.com/lustre-labs/lustre

```gleam
//
// Before
//
html.div(
  [],
  [
    stack.of(
      html.nav, 
      [stack.tight()],
      [
        html.h3([], [text("Guides")]),
        html.a(
          [href("/guides/wisp")],
          [text("Integrating Lustre with Wisp framework")],
        ),
      ]
    ),
  ],
)

//
// After
//
html.div([], [
  stack.of(html.nav, [stack.tight()], [
    html.h3([], [text("Guides")]),
    html.a([href("/guides/wisp")], [
      text("Integrating Lustre with Wisp"),
    ]),
  ]),
])
```

Thank you to [Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri) for this feature!

Additionally, the `gleam format` command will ignore build directories even
outside of git repositories. Thank you [Alessandro Scandone](https://github.com/ascandone).


## Encouraging semantic versioning

Gleam's package manager uses semantic versioning and the [Pubgrub][6] algorithm
to pick versions of each package that are compatible with each other. This helps
avoid dependency headaches, but it only works if package authors follow semantic
versioning.

[6]: https://nex3.medium.com/pubgrub-2fb6470504f

Developers often have a habit of using `0.x.x` versions instead of following
semantic versioning, undermining the work the package manager does to avoid
unexpected breakages. If you're publishing a package then it's worth taking
versioning seriously to give your users the best experience, even if you intend
to do more work on the package in future.

To encourage moving past version zero Gleam now creates new projects at `1.0.0`,
and asks for confirmation when publishing a version zero package. It will also
ask for confirmation if you try to publish a package with the name prefix
`gleam_`, which implies the package is maintained by the Gleam core team.

In future Gleam may have additional publishing features, such as analysing the
difference between the last published version and the current version to suggest
an appropriate new semantic version number, as the Elm package manager does.


## Web Assembly API revamp

The Gleam compiler can be compiled to WASM, allowing it to be used in the
browser or anywhere else WASM can be used. The JavaScript bindings to this API
have been improved, given support for multiple projects, and now expose warnings
as well as errors.

```javascript
const compiler = await import("/compiler/gleam_wasm.js");
await compiler.default();
compiler.initialise_panic_hook();

compiler.write_module(0, "mod", "pub fn add(a, b) { a + b }");
compiler.compile_package(0, "javascript")
compiler.read_compiled_javascript(0, "mod")
// This returns:
// "export function add(a, b) {\n  return a + b;\n }\n"
```

This new API is still a little low-level. In future we may have a more
sophisticated one, if that would be useful to folks. Currently this API is being
used to create a new in-browser interactive playground and tutorial for Gleam,
which we hope to release in January.


## Language additions

The `\u{...}` syntax can now be used in strings to specify unicode codepoints by
their hexadecimal number. Thank you [F. Schwalbe](https://github.com/fschwalbe)
and [Adi Salimgereev](https://github.com/abs0luty).

The `panic as "..."` and `todo as "..."` syntaxes now accept any expression that
evaluates to a string, rather than just a string literal. Thank you
[Om Prakaash](https://github.com/omprakaash).

The words `auto`, `delegate`, `derive`, `else`, `implement`, `macro`, and `test`
are now reserved for future use. This is done as we soon to hope to release a
version `1.0.0` of Gleam, after which point we will be committed to not breaking
backwards compatibility. Reserving these words now will allow us to use them for
new language features in the future.

The bool negation `!` operator can now be used in clause guard expressions.

The deprecated bit string, ambiguous type import, and JavaScript prelude inspect
features have been removed.


## Build tool additions

The `gleam export erlang-shipment` command, used to create an artefact suitable
for deployment on a server, now supports Windows. Thank you
[bun](https://github.com/bunopnu).

It is possible for Elixir and Erlang packages to have a different name according
to the virtual machine than to the package manager. These packages are now
supported by the build tool and can be added as dependencies to Gleam projects.

The search bar in generated HTML documentation has been improved, making better
suggestions for partial matches. Thank you [F. Schwalbe](https://github.com/fschwalbe).

The `gleam run` and `gleam test` commands gain the -t flag, which is an alias of
the --target flag. Thank you [shayan javani](https://github.com/massivefermion).

The short forms of `js` and `erl` can now be used as values for the `--target`
flag on all commands that accept it. Thank you
[Mani Sundararajan](https://github.com/itsrainingmani).


## Thanks
