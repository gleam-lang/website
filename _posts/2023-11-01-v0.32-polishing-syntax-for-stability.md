Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam [v0.32.0][release] has been published, a
release that focuses on getting Gleam ready for a v1.0 release by making some
breaking changes before the language is declared stable.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.32.0


## Resolving import ambiguity

Here is what Gleam's import syntax looks like:

```gleam
import gleam/option.{Option, Some, None}

pub fn greet(option: Option(String)) -> String {
  case option {
    Some(name) -> "Hello " <> name
    None -> "Hello, World!"
  }
}
```

Here the module `gleam/option` is being imported, and the values `Some`, and
`None` and the type `Option` are being imported in an unqualified manner so
they can be referred to without the `module_name.` prefix.

While `Option` is a type and `None` is a value they are both imported using the
same syntax. This becomes more complex when we consider that in Gleam a type and
a value can have the same name. For example:

```gleam
/// A type called `Person`
pub type Person {
  /// A value constructor, also called `Person`
  Person(name: String)
}
```

In this case when you read the code `import the/module.{Person}` you cannot tell
if the type is being imported, the value, or both. This ambiguity is resolved by
the compiler by checking to see how the imported item is used.

Clarity is a core goals of Gleam, so to ease the cognitive load of reading Gleam
code the syntax for importing types and values has been altered.

```gleam
import gleam/option.{type Option, Some, None}
```

To import a type the keyword `type` is used before the name, no keyword being
used for a value. Now it is always clear what an import statement is doing!

The old syntax is still supported, but will be removed in a future release, and
a deprecation warning will be emitted when it is used.


## BitString -> BitArray

Gleam has a type for a contiguous sequence of bits. It is similar to Python's
`bytes` type, however it is not restricted to 8 bit bytes, it can be any number
of bits.

It also features a literal syntax for construction and pattern matching, so much
of what you would need to use bitwise operations for in other languages can be
done with a simpler syntax.

```gleam
pub fn seven_bit_little_endian_int() -> BitString {
  <<2:size(7)-little>>
}
```

This feature, which Gleam inherited from Erlang, is much loved by the community
except for the name. Many Gleam users, especially those coming from languages
other than Erlang or Elixir, find the name `BitString` confusing. What does it
have to do with strings? It is for text only?

This confusion is understandable, and so the name has been changed to
`BitArray`, and in the pattern syntax the `binary` and `bit_string` options have
been renamed to `bytes` and `bits`, hopefully making their purpose clearer.
Along with this the `gleam/bit_string` standard library module has been
deprecated in favour of `gleam/bit_array`. The old names and module are
deprecated and will be removed in a future release.


## The return of `gleam fix`

Wow, that's a lot of deprecated stuff! It's going to be annoying to fix all the
existing code, right? Thankfully not, as the `gleam fix` command is back.

Run `gleam fix` in the root of any Gleam package and it will automatically
update your code to use the new syntax. It will also update the `gleam.toml`
file to set the Gleam version constraint to `>= 0.32.0`, ensuring that if you
publish your package to the Hex package manager any users on older versions of
Gleam won't get confusing errors coming from the new syntax.


## Language server code actions

The `gleam` binary includes the compiler, the build tool, the package manager,
and also the language server, which provides IDE features to VS Code, Vim,
Emacs, and any other edit which support the protocol.

With this release the language server gets its first code action! It can now
automatically remove all unused imports with a single press of a button.

This is a nice convenience feature, but it also means that the language server
internally has the infrastructure in place to add more code actions in future.
User experience and productivity is highly important to us, so the language
server will be getting more code actions and new features in future releases.

Thank you [Tristan de Cacqueray](https://github.com/TristanCacqueray) for this
feature!


## Target specific `gleam check`

If during development you want to see whether your code type checks but don't
care about compiling it to run your tests you can use the `gleam check` command.

With this release it gains the `--target` flag, allowing you to specify a
compilation target other than the default for the package. This is useful in
packages that use conditional compilation, a less common but sometimes necessary
Gleam feature.

Thank you [Kunal Kundu](https://github.com/tinfoil-knight) for this feature!


## Module access in guard expressions

Values defined in other modules can now be referenced in case clause guards
expressions using the `module_name.value` syntax.

```gleam
import some/module.{type Person}

pub fn greet(person: Person) -> String {
  case person {
    Person(name: n) if n == module.friends_name -> "Hey Buddy!"
    _ -> "Hello! Welcome!"
  }
}
```

Thank you [Shayan Javani](https://github.com/massivefermion) for this feature!

## Bit array constants on the JavaScript target

Bit arrays can now be used in constant expressions on the JavaScript target.

```gleam
pub const some_bits = <<1, 2, 3, 4>>
```

Thank you [Shayan Javani](https://github.com/massivefermion) for this feature!

## `@deprecated` types

The previous release added the `@deprecated` attribute, which could be used to
mark values as deprecated. This release extends this to allow type definitions
to be marked as deprecated too.

```gleam
@deprecated("Use the Pet type instead")
pub type Animal {
  Cat
  Dog
}
```

When a type is marked as deprecated the compiler will emit a warning when the
type or any of its value constructors are referenced.

Thank you [Om Prakaash](https://github.com/omprakaash) for this feature!


## Thanks

Gleam is made possible by the support of all the kind people and companies who have
very generously [**sponsored**](https://github.com/sponsors/lpil) or
contributed to the project. Thank you all!

If you like Gleam consider sponsoring or asking your employer to
