Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam [v0.24.0][release] has been released, let's
take a look at what's new.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.24.0


## In-project Elixir support

The Gleam build tool has always supported compilation of modules written in
Gleam or Erlang, but now it supports Elixir modules as well. Any `.ex` files of
Elixir code in the `src` directory will be automatically compiled for you when
you run `gleam build`, `gleam test`, etc.

```sh
$ tree
# .
# ├── gleam.toml
# └── src
#     └── project.ex
# 
# 1 directories, 2 files
$ gleam run
# Hello from Elixir in a Gleam project!
```

This means that Gleam projects can now make full use of Elixir code and
libraries, including those that use Elixir's macro system, which cannot be used
directly from other languages.

Note this does not mean that we are type checking Elixir code or can tell the
type signatures of any Elixir functions. Elixir code will continue to be
imported using Gleam's [external functions](https://gleam.run/book/tour/external-functions.html)
feature.

Thank you to [Tynan Beatty](https://github.com/tynanbe) for this feature, and
for his tireless work on Gleam-Elixir interop.

## <> operator

Gleam now has a `<>` operator which works on strings. In an expression it
immutably concatenates two string into a new one.

```gleam
let who = "Joe"
"Hello, " <> who <> "!"
// => "Hello, Joe!"
```

When used in a pattern it can be used to match strings that have a given prefix.

```gleam
case input {
  "Hello, " <> name -> name
  _other -> "Unknown"
}
```

These new string patterns means that we can write string parsers that compile
efficiently to Erlang bytecode using the virtual machine's highly optimised
pattern matching functionality.

As a little demo, here's a toy Lisp interpreter written in Gleam that uses this
feature:
[gleam-lang/example-lisp-interpreter](https://github.com/gleam-lang/example-lisp-interpreter/).


## The Developer Survey

If you're a Gleam user, or just someone who is interested in Gleam, please
consider filling in this year's [Gleam Developer Survey][survey]. Gleam's
community is growing so we're keen to get a better understanding of who you
folks are and how we could make Gleam even better for you. Once we have this
information we will use it to influence and prioritise Gleam development in
2023.

The survey is an in-browser single-page-application and web service backend,
both written in Gleam and deployed to [Fly](https://fly.io). If you'd like to
read the source code it can be found [on GitHub][survey-source].

## And more

In addition to those main features we've fixed bugs and improved error messages,
the highlights being:

Elixir dependency package support now works on Windows. Thank you
[Smaehtin](https://github.com/Smaehtin)!

If the programmer attempts to use the object-oriented method call syntax
(`value.method()`) we now return a more detailed error that explains that Gleam
is not object oriented, and suggests using the functional syntax. This will
hopefully help people who are less familiar with functional programming
languages.

For all the changes see the [changelog file on GitHub](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#0240-rc1---2022-10-15).

## How can I try it?

Instructions on how to install the latest version of Gleam can be found on the
[getting started page][getting-started] of the website. Once installed check out
the language tour for an introduction to the language.
