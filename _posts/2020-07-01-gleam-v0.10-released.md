1 month and 10,910 lines of code later it is time for another Gleam
release! Let's see what's new this time.


## Module constants

Sometimes we want to use a certain fixed value in multiple places in our
project. Until now we've had two options. The first option was to copy and
paste the value into multiple places in our code.

```gleam
pub fn is_before(year: Int) -> Bool {
  year < 2101
}

pub fn is_during(year: Int) -> Bool {
  2101 <= year && year <= 2111
}
```

Duplication of values like this is error prone, especially if we want to
update the values later, as we'll need to find every place it's used in order
to change it.

Another option is to wrap the value in a function.


```gleam
pub fn start_year() -> Int {
  2101
}

pub fn end_year() -> Int {
  2111
}

pub fn is_before(year: Int) -> Bool {
  year < start_year()
}

pub fn is_during(year: Int) -> Bool {
  start_year() <= year && year <= end_year()
}
```

This is better than copying the value in our code, but isn't yet ideal. A
function can perform any amount of computation (with side effects!) when it is
called, so we have to read the definition of the function to be sure what it
does.

To make matters worse Gleam's case clause guards don't support calling of
functions within them, so this code will be rejected by the compiler:

```gleam
pub describe(year: Int) -> String {
  case year {
    year if year < start_year() -> "Before"
    year if year > end_year() -> "After"
    _ -> "During"
  }
}
```

To solve all these problems Gleam now has module constants. They are always
inlined by the compiler, and can be used in case clause guards.

Using them the above code can be rewritten like so:


```gleam
pub const start_year: Int = 2101
pub const end_year: Int = 2111

pub fn is_before(year: Int) -> Bool {
  year < start_year
}

pub fn is_during(year: Int) -> Bool {
  start_year <= year && year <= end_year
}

pub describe(year: Int) -> String {
  case year {
    year if year < start_year -> "Before"
    year if year > end_year -> "After"
    _ -> "During"
  }
}
```

Much better! Module constants are going to provide the basis of some exciting
new features in future, so watch this space. ðŸš€

Thanks to [Ahmad Sattar](https://github.com/thehabbos007) for taking the
lead in the implementation of this feature.


## Bit string syntax

One of great things about Erlang is how easy it is to work with raw bits and
bytes using the bit string literal syntax. Starting with this release Gleam
supports this too!

Explaining all the things one can do with the bit string syntax would take
longer than I have now, but in short they give a declarative way of
constructing and parsing raw data of any format. What's more the Erlang VM is
highly optimised for this, so bit syntax is highly efficient too!

For example, if I wanted to create a 32 bit unsigned little endian integer
with the value of 100 I could do so using bit syntax like this:

```gleam
let my_integer = <<100:unsigned-little-int-size(32)>>
```

Or if I wanted to extract the title, artist, album, year, and comment from an
MP3 music file's ID3 tags I could pattern match on it like this:

```gleam
pub fn get_metadata(id3: BitString) -> Result(Metadata, String) {
  case id3 {
    <<
      "TAG":utf8,
      title:binary-size(30),
      artist:binary-size(30),
      album:binary-size(30),
      year:binary-size(4),
      comment:binary-size(30),
      _rest:binary,
    >> -> Ok(Metadata(title, artist, album, year, comment))

    _ -> Error("Not a valid ID3 tag")
  }
}
```

Thanks to [Benjamin Tan's blog post][bit-string-blog]
for this example.

For another example of bit syntax in action check out this [_very serious_
base64 encoding alternative][ecoji] which converts arbitrary data into emojis!

As part of this new feature we have introduced `BitString` and `UtfCodepoint`
types into the prelude, and split the standard library `Iodata` type into
[`StringBuilder`][string-builder] and [`BitBuilder`][bit-builder] types, which
are for efficiently constructing strings and bit strings respectively.

Thanks to [Tom Whatmore](https://github.com/tomwhatmore) for taking the
lead in the implementation of this feature.


## The rest

There are many more new additions, improvements, and bug fixes to the compiler and
the standard library, including but not limited to support for regex expressions
(implemented by [Erik Terpstra](https://github.com/eterps/)) and environment
variables (implemented by [Peter Saxton](https://github.com/crowdhailer/)).

For information on the rest in this release please check out the [Gleam
changelog][gleam-changelog] and the [standard library
changelog][stdlib-changelog].

## Supporting Gleam

If you would like to help make strongly typed programming on the Erlang
virtual machine a production-ready reality please consider **[sponsoring
Gleam][sponsor]** via the GitHub Sponsors program.

This release would not have been possible without the support of all the
people who have [sponsored](https://github.com/sponsors/lpil) and contributed
to it, so a huge thank you to them.
