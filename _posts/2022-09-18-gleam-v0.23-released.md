Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam [v0.23.0][release] has been released, let's
take a look at what's new.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.23.0


## Elixir support

Gleam runs on the Erlang virtual machine alongside an assortment of other
excellent languages, and as such we want to take advantage of all the packages
written in those languages.

Previously projects using Gleam's build tool could depend on packages written in
Gleam or Erlang. With this release projects written in
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) are also supported, giving Gleam programmers
access to practically all the packages found on [Hex](https://hex.pm/), the
package manager for the Erlang ecosystem.

The developer-experience for using Elixir packages in Gleam is the same as using
Erlang packages.

```sh
# Add an Elixir package to the Gleam project
$ gleam add tzdata
```
```gleam
// Import a function from the package
external fn tzdata_version() -> String =
  "Elixir.Tzdata" "tzdata_version"

// Use it in Gleam
pub fn main() {
  io.println(tzdata_version())
}
```

Thank you to [Tynan Beatty](https://github.com/tynanbe) for this feature, and
thank you to the Elixir community for all they give to the BEAM ecosystem!

## Package updating

We want it to be as easy as possible to use code written by others, and we want
to avoid "dependency hell", so the user experience of the build tool is an
important area for Gleam.

One missing part of the puzzle so far as been upgrading the package versions
that your project depends on. It has largely been a manual process previously.

With this release there is a new `gleam update` command which will efficiently
resolve the latest compatible versions for dependencies using the
[PubGrub](https://nex3.medium.com/pubgrub-2fb6470504f) algorithm.

```sh
$ gleam update
# Tada, you're on the latest versions!
```

## Searchable documentation

Gleam generates documentation for packages and publishes the HTML to
[HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/), the documentation site for the Erlang ecosystem.

With this release generated documentation includes a search bar so that functions,
types, and modules can be found faster than easier than ever.  The search is
powered by the [Lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) JavaScript library and as such
supports fuzz-matching to help with typos, or for when you can't quite remember
the name of what you're after.

Give the documentation search a try with [the standard library documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/0.23.0/index.html) today.

Thank you to [Lucas de Ávila Martins](https://github.com/lucasavila00) for this
feature!

## And more

Those are the main features, but there's also an assortment of other changes:

- Constant expressions can now contain and reference functions. Thank you
  [Eddie Hatfield](https://github.com/e-hat)!
- Compiler performance has been improved by buffering outputs and lazily loading
  resources. In tests this quadrupled performance when compiling the standard
  library.
- The LSP will now provide rudimentary autocompletion for importable modules.
- The code formatter style has been improved.
- The `gleam publish` command will include the `priv` directory (for non-code
  package artefacts) and can be run non-interactively. Thank you
  [Tynan Beatty](https://github.com/tynanbe)!


## How can I try it?

Instructions on how to install the latest version of Gleam can be found on the
[getting started page][getting-started] of the website. Once installed check out
the language tour for an introduction to the language.
