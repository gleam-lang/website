Gleam is a type safe and scalable language for the Erlang virtual machine and
JavaScript runtimes. Today Gleam [v1.1.0][release] has been published, just a
month after v1.0.0. There's loads of new stuff in this release, so take a look
at some of what's new!

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v1.1.0


## Language server improvements

Productivity and developer experience is a first class concern to us, and in a
modern language good editor support is an important part of the puzzle. To help
Gleam has a built-in language server which is developed and maintained by the
core team. The language server is relatively immature compared to the rest of
the language's tooling, and it is one of the main focuses for core development
at the moment.

It has been improved in these ways:

### Compilation batching

The language server is driven by messages sent by your editor each time a file
is opened, code is edited, autocompletions are needed, and so on. When messages
are received the language server runs the compiler (minus the codegen sections)
to get information about the code.

The language server now batches theses messages intelligently, compiling when is
required rather than on every message. For example, if your editor rapidly sends
several text edits and then a request for refactorings the language server will
now apply all the edits to its in-memory filesystem overlay before compiling a
single time. If you are using a faster computer you likely will see no
difference, but if you're using a slower computer or in a very large project
you'll no longer experience a delay before getting feedback from the language
server.

### Autocomplete imports

The language server will now autocomplete module names when writing import
statements. Thank you [Ameen Radwan](https://github.com/Acepie) for this improvement!

### Global todo definition 

Gleam's language server previously supported go-to definition for values defined
in the top-level package, but with this release it also works for values defined
in dependency packages too. Thank you [Ameen Radwan](https://github.com/Acepie) again!

## Bun support

Gleam compiles to JavaScript as well as Erlang, and there are multiple popular
options for running JavaScript code on the command line. Gleam supports the
NodeJS and Deno runtimes, and with v1.1.0 Bun support has been added too!

To use Bun either add `javascript.runtime` key to your `gleam.toml`, or add
the `--runtime=bun` flag to your `gleam run` or `gleam test` command.

```toml
name = "app"
version = "1.0.0"
target = "javascript"

[javascript]
runtime = "bun"
```

Thank you [gubsey](https://github.com/gubsey) for this feature.

## Rebar support

Rebar3 is the standard Erlang build tool but some projects use the older built
tool rebar (without the 3). Rebar3 has some amount of backwards compatibility
with rebar and can build a typical rebar project, so with this release Gleam
will now use rebar3 to build any rebar packages added as dependencies. This is
enough to use all rebar packages we've found on the package manager so far.

Thank you [Isaac Harris-Holt](https://github.com/isaacharrisholt) for this feature!

## Formatter improvements

[Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri) the pretty-printing
wizard has been hard at work improving the formatter and fixing bugs. One
highlight is that the formatter will now sort groups of imports into
alphabetical order automatically.

[Juho Eerola](https://github.com/juntuu) also improved support for non-`\n`
newlines to the formatter, causing them to be converted to `\n` rather than
discarding them, which previously resulted in some empty lines being removed.

## Clearer dependency requirements

Gleam uses the Hex package manager, and Hex specifies a syntax for version
constraints. The syntax `~> 1.0`, which means `>= 1.0.0 and <
2.0.0`, and Gleam would use this in your `gleam.toml` when adding a dependency
with `gleam add`.

This syntax was very commonly misunderstood by people, and often would be
confused for the `~> 1.0.0` syntax, which looks very similar but does something
different and undesirable. To avoid this repeated confusion the longer and
easier to understand syntax is now used instead.

## JavaScript list optimistion

[Julian Schurhammer](https://github.com/schurhammer) identified and implemented
an optimisation for prepending to a list on the JavaScript target. List
prepending is extremely common in Gleam, so optimisations here have a big
impact. Once applied running the standard library test suite went from ~3.0
seconds to ~2.4 seconds. Thank you Julian!

```sh
# before

2.98s user 0.37s system 135% cpu 2.471 total
2.85s user 0.37s system 133% cpu 2.409 total
3.00s user 0.39s system 134% cpu 2.516 total

# after

2.37s user 0.35s system 132% cpu 2.048 total
2.33s user 0.37s system 134% cpu 2.009 total
2.38s user 0.36s system 134% cpu 2.034 total
```

## Internal types and values

Gleam has a concept of _internal modules_, which are modules that are only to be
used from within the same package. With is release the `@internal` attribute can
be used to make a type or value internal in a module that is otherwise
not-internal. This may be helpful for exposing functionality so that it can be
directly tested, while not making it part of the package's public API.


Thank you [Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri) for this feature!

## Dead code elimination

Gleam packages can be cross-target and work on both Erlang and JavaScript.
These packages may have target specific dependencies which are only used on one
target or the other.

The compiler now performs more aggressive dead-code elimination and will remove
any code that is unreachable for the target that is currently being used.

## Better package validation

Since v1.0.0 the number of Gleam packages has really taken off, [new ones being
published every day](https://packages.gleam.run/).

We don't just want a healthy number of packages, we also want to ensure that
Gleam packages are as high quality as possible. With this release we have some
more things that we will be checking packages for before publishing, to catch
common mistakes.

The `gleam.toml` project file includes the location of the source code
repository for the package. Sometimes folks would make typos or forget to make
the repository public, making the documentation's links there unusable. When
publishing Gleam will now make a request to this URL to ensure it loads
successfully.

The Hex package manager has rules against name squatting, and empty packages
published to reserve a name may be removed. Gleam now checks to make sure that
blank packages are not published, and warns the publisher this is against the
Hex terms of service.

## Improved diagnostics

Gleam's warnings and errors try to be as helpful as possible, hopefully making
it clear how your code can be improved. Several improved error messages and new
warnings have been added:

A `case` expression in Gleam can pattern match on multiple subjects at once.
Folks not be aware of this an may instead wrap multiple values in a redundant
tuple as would be required in some other language. This now causes a warning to
be emitted:

<img src="/images/news/gleam-v1.1-released/spread.png" class="shadow" style="width: 700px" alt="An error about a tuple being redundant">

In a future release the language server will have a code-action to remove this
for you.

Another new warning is this one that is emitted when a literal expression or a
side-effect free expression is not used. This helps the programmer catch dead
code, and possibly also identify problems such as the missing `<>` in the
example here:

<img src="/images/news/gleam-v1.1-released/unused.png" class="shadow" style="width: 700px" alt="A warning about an unusued value">

And lastly, an example of an improved error. One mistake people unfamiliar with
immutable linked lists might make is to attempt to append to a list using the
list syntax. This syntax only works for prepending as prepending is fast, while
appending is slow.

<img src="/images/news/gleam-v1.1-released/spread.png" class="shadow" style="width: 700px" alt="An error explaining why a spread is invalid">

Thank you [Giacomo Cavalieri](https://github.com/giacomocavalieri) for these improvements!

## Improved tuple parsing

Tuples can be indexed into using the `.0`, `.1`, `.2`, etc syntax, but with
previous versions of the parser indexing into nested tuples like `tuple.0.2`
would not parse successfully. Thank you to [Nikita Sobolev](https://github.com/sobolevn)
for fixing this problem!

## And the rest

That's enough for this post, but there's lots more. If you'd like to see all the
changes for this release check out [the changelog](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v110---2024-04-16)
