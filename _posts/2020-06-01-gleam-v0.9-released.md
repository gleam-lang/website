Thanks to all our new contributors Gleam's development is faster than ever and
it's time for another release! Let's take a look.


## Improved error handling

The main way that errors are represented and handled in Gleam is through the
Result type. It's baked into the language itself, but if you were to implement
it in a library it would be implemented like so:

```rust
pub type Result(success_value, failure_detail) {
  Ok(success_value)
  Error(failure_detail)
}
```

If a function can fail then it returns a Result, wrapping a successful return
value in an Ok record, or returning detail on the failure in an Error record
if it's not successful.

```rust
// parse_int(String) -> Result(Int, String)

parse_int("123") // -> Ok(123)
parse_int("erl") // -> Error("expected a number, got `erl`")
```

When a function returns a Result we can pattern match on it to handle success
and failure:

```rust
case parse_int("123") {
  Error(e) -> io.println("That wasn't an Int")
  Ok(i) -> io.println("We parsed the Int")
}
```

This works but if you need to handle multiple Result values in the same
function then it becomes verbose, and the error handling obscures the business
logic.

```rust
case parse_int(a) {
  Error(e) -> Error(e)
  Ok(int_a) -> case parse_int(b) {
    Error(e) -> Error(e)
    Ok(int_b) -> Ok(int_a) -> case parse_int(c) {
      Error(e) -> Error(e)
      Ok(int_c) -> Ok(int_a + int_b + int_c)
    }
  }
}
```

With this release Gleam now has the `try` keyword which makes error handling
easier and more concise. Rewritten using `try` the previous example looks like
this:

```rust
try int_a = parse_int(a)
try int_b = parse_int(b)
try int_c = parse_int(c)
Ok(int_a + int_b + int_c)
```

When a variable is declared using `try` Gleam checks to see whether the value
is an Error or an Ok record. If it's an Ok then the inner value is assigned to
the variable:

```rust
try x = Ok(1)
Ok(x + 1)
// -> Ok(2)
```
If it's an Error then the Error is returned immediately:

```rust
try x = Error("failure")
Ok(x + 1)
// -> Error("failure")
```

We've been testing `try` in our applications for a while and we're very happy
with how it cleans up error handling. Why not give it a try? 😜


## Opaque types

Gleam's new opaque type feature allows a library writer to export a custom
type without exporting the internal details of the type.

```rust
// in src/box.gleam
pub opaque type Box {
  Box(inner_value: Int)
}

pub fn new(x: Int) -> Box {
  Box(inner_value: x)
}
```

If another module imports this custom type they will be able to create a `Box`
using the `new` function, but they cannot call the `Box` constructor, use the
`.inner_value` accessor, or pattern match on a Box to get the inner value.

```rust
import box

let one = box.new(1) // This is permitted
one.inner_value      // Compile error!
let box.Box(i) = one // Compile error!
box.Box(1)           // Compile error!
```

This feature is great for creating a carefully controlled API for your data
types, hiding any private implementation details to ensure that they are used
correctly, which brings us to the next features:


## Standard library additions

The standard library has gained a wealth of new modules, types, and functions.
Here's some of the highlights, some of which were made possible with the new
opaque type feature.

### Iterator

The new Iterator type is a lazily evaluated sequence of elements, similar to
the Stream type in Elixir.

Iterators are useful when working with collections that are too large to fit
in memory (or those that are infinite in size) as they only require the
elements currently being processed to be in memory.

Here we can see the Iterator type used to create an infinitely long sequence
of Ints, which is then mapped over, and the first 5 elements are evaluated.

```rust
import gleam/iterator

let double = fn(x) { x * 2 }

[1, 2, 3]
|> iterator.from_list   // Create a 3 element iterator
|> iterator.cycle       // Repeat the iterator forever
|> iterator.map(double) // Double each element
|> iterator.take(5)     // Evaluate the first 5 elements
// -> [2, 4, 6, 2, 4]
```

Because Iterators are lazy even though this Iterator has infinite size the
`double` function is only called 5 times.

For more information see the [iterator
documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/iterator/).


### Set

A Set is a collection value. Unlike a List, it is unordered, cannot contain
duplicate values, and finding a value in a Set is very fast.

```rust
import gleam/set

let pop_band = set.new(["Iris", "Karl", "Priya"])

set.contains(pop_band, "Iris")
// -> True

set.contains(pop_band, "Martin")
// -> False
```

For more information see the [set
documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/set/).


### Queue

A Queue is an ordered collection of elements. It's similar to a List, however
it's fast to add and remove from both ends of a queue, while a list can only
be quickly accessed from the front.

```rust
import gleam/queue

queue.new()
|> queue.push_front(1)
|> queue.push_front(2)
|> queue.push_back(3)
|> queue.push_back(4)
|> queue.to_list
// -> [2, 1, 3, 4]
```

For more information see the [queue
documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/queue/).


### Option

Option is a type used to represent values which may be present or absent,
making it similar to nullable values in other languages. It's defined like so:

```rust
pub type Option(a) {
  Some(a)
  None
}
```

If an optional Int "`some_int`" is present it's represented as
`Some(the_int)`, while if it's absent it's `None`.

For more information see the [option
documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/gleam_stdlib/gleam/option/).


## The rest

Other additions to the standard library include an `io` module, additions to
the `result`, `dynamic`, `list`, and `string` modules, and some changes to
labels to make them more consistent. For full details see [the
changelog](https://github.com/gleam-lang/stdlib/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#090---2020-05-26).

Other additions to the compiler include improvements to the formatter style,
the ability to include additional markdown pages in generated code
documentation, initial support for Elixir's `mix` build tool, type annotations
on `let` + `assert` + `try`, custom type support in case clause guards, and
several bug fixes. For more info see [the changelog](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v090---2020-06-01)
