The [Gleam Developer Survey 2024][survey] is here!

The last one was run in 2022 (see the results [here][2022]), but a lot has
happened since then, so it's high-time for another one.

As well as being fun to learn about the community, the results of this survey
will shape what features and improvements the core team will work on next year.
This year the focus was on the language server, and that has been a tremendous
success, so be sure to fill in the survey and share it with your friends so we
can have have an equally fantastic 2025.

You don't need to be an active Gleam user to fill in the survey. If you're not
yet found the time to try Gleam we still want to hear from you!
