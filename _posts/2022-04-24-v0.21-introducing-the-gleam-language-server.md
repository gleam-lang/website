title: Introducing the Gleam language server!

Gleam is a type safe, scalable, and productivity focused language for the Erlang
virtual machine. Today Gleam [v0.21.0][release] has been released, which
includes the first version of the Gleam Language Server, bringing IDE features
to all major editors.

[release]: https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/v0.21.0


## What's a language server?

We believe that excellent developer tooling is just as much a core concern of
the language as a fast & reliable compiler, and ergonomic & productive language
design. We want to Gleam developers to have access to the IDE features that they
would find in popular mainstream languages such as inline errors, goto
definition, autocompletion, and more.

Traditionally this would mean picking a popular editor and writing a plugin for
it to add these features for your language. This works well if you are using the
chosen editor, but everybody else is out of luck.

Some projects created an IDE API abstraction which could be used to power
plug-ins for many editors. This works much better in that more people can use
these features, however there is still quite a lot of work to integrate with all
of the different editors that may be used.

When faced with this problem the clever folks at Microsoft developed and
published a standardised API for communication between editors and IDE engines,
called the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)][lsp]. This protocol has been widely
adopted, so now a language only needs to implement the API once in order to
reach most users.

<img class="no-shadow" src="/images/news/gleam-v0.21-released/lsp-languages-editors.png" alt="A graph showing N*M integrations between editors and language without LSP, and N+M integrations with LSP">

With this latest release Gleam now implements the language server protocol.
Let's see what it can do!

### Compilation

The language server will compile your Gleam projects every time you hit save.
Any errors or warnings emitted during compilation will be shown inline and can
be jumped to with your editor.

  <source src="/images/news/gleam-v0.21-released/compile.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="/images/news/gleam-v0.21-released/compile.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

### Formatting

Manually formatting and maintaining a consistent style in your codebase is a
drag, so the language server integrates the Gleam source code formatter. Every
time you hit save it will format your code for you in the official Gleam style.

  <source src="/images/news/gleam-v0.21-released/formatting.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="/images/news/gleam-v0.21-released/formatting.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

### Hover

Hovering over an expression in your Gleam code will show the type of the
resulting value.

  <source src="/images/news/gleam-v0.21-released/hover.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="/images/news/gleam-v0.21-released/hover.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

### Go-to definition

And lastly, you can jump to or peek the definition of any Gleam expression.

<video autoplay loop muted playsinline>
  <source src="/images/news/gleam-v0.21-released/goto-definition.webm" type="video/webm">
  <source src="/images/news/gleam-v0.21-released/goto-definition.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>

## What's next?

This is just the first version of the language server, there's still lots more
to come, including but not limited to:

- IntelliSense autocompletion.
- Go-to definition for patterns and types.
- Support for all language server features within dependency packages.
- Checking and compilation on every keystroke.
- Type directed refactorings.
- Partial compilation to provide type information even when the module does not
  compile successfully.

Thank you [Weslei Juan Novaes Pereira](https://github.com/wesleimp) and [Harry
Bairstow](https://github.com/HarryET/) for all their help in creating the
language server!

That's all for the first version of the language server, but this is also a
regular Gleam release, so let's take a look at what's new outside the language
server.

## Boolean negation

A nice little quality of life improvement, boolean values can now be negated
using the new `!` operator. Previously the `bool.negate` function would be used.

```gleam
!True  // => False
!False // => True
```

Thank you [Harry Bairstow](https://github.com/HarryET/) for this feature, and
[Andrew Varner](https://github.com/varnerac) for the idea!

## Git initialisation

When a new Gleam project is created the build tool will initialise it as a git
project if the `git` binary is installed.

```sh
gleam new my_cool_project
cd my_cool_project
git status --short --branch
# ## No commits yet on main
# ?? .github/
# ?? .gitignore
# ?? README.md
# ?? gleam.toml
# ?? src/
# ?? test/
```

Thank you [Weslei Juan Novaes Pereira](https://github.com/wesleimp) for this
feature, and [Kayla Washburn](https://github.com/aslilac) for the idea!

## Bit string construction on JavaScript

Gleam inherits from Erlang a powerful literal syntax for creating arrays of bits
and bytes. This has full support when compiling to Erlang but when compiling to
JavaScript the support is more limited.

With this release support has been added for int, float, and sized segments.

```js
<<1.1:float>>  // Insert a float
<<256:int>>    // Insert an int
<<3:size(16)>> // Insert an 16 bit int
```

Thank you [Peter Saxton](https://github.com/wesleimp) for this feature!

## gleam add multiple

`gleam add` now support multiple packages, so you can add more than one
dependency with a single command.

```sh
gleam add gleam_json gleam_http
#   Resolving versions
# Downloading packages
#  Downloaded 5 packages in 0.04s
#       Added gleam_json v0.4.0
#       Added gleam_http v3.0.0
```

Thank you [Filip Figiel](https://github.com/megapctr) and
[Marcin Puc](https://github.com/tranzystorek-io) for this feature!

## Nightly builds

Sometimes people want to try new Gleam features that have been merged into the
codebase but not released yet. Previously they would have to download the
source code and compile it themselves, which can take a very long time!

To help here we now build the compiler binaries every night and upload them to GitHub for anyone to download. Find the nightly release [here](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases/tag/nightly).

Thank you [Harry Bairstow](https://github.com/HarryET/) for this feature, and
[cognivore](https://github.com/cognivore) for the idea!

## And the rest

The standard library gained lots of new functions, including ones for
constructing random values. Thank you
[inoas](https://github.com/inoas), [Sebastian Porto](https://github.com/sporto),
[Hayleigh Thompson](https://github.com/hayleigh-dot-dev), and
[E Jikan](https://github.com/vstreame)!

The build directory caches are cleared when the compiler version changes. This
prevents bugs arising from changes in metadata formats. Thank you [E Jikan](https://github.com/vstreame)!

A warning is emitted if a module is imported but not used. Thank you [E Jikan](https://github.com/vstreame)!

Rebar3 based Erlang dependencies can now be compiled on Windows.

And as always, error messages have been improved and bugs have been fixed. Thank
you [E Jikan](https://github.com/vstreame), [Lukas Wirth](https://github.com/Veykril),
[Matthew Cobbing](https://github.com/cobbinma), [Tynan Beatty](https://github.com/tynanbe),
and [inoas](https://github.com/inoas)!
