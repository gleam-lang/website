It has been two months since the last one, so now it's time for another Gleam
release! Let's see what's new this time:

## Improved error messages

Since the last release we've put a lot of work into the error messages emitted
by the compiler. The most common and arguably the most important type of error
is the type error, so we want it to be as clear and as friendly as possible.

Here's what it looks like with Gleam v0.7:

This is a big improvement over previous versions which would struggle with
highlighting multi-line code sections, and would state the problem as being
`Int != Float` rather than `List(Int) != List(Float)`.

Other improved error messages include the import cycle error message:

Error messages for invalid patterns in case expressions:

And a slew of error messages relating to errors when trying to read or write
files in a Gleam project.

Gleam aims to be an exceptionally friendly and productive language, so error
messages are important. If there are any errors that you find confusing or
unclear please get in touch and let us know!

In adding these new error messages we discovered a bug in rebar3 where unicode
characters would be printed incorrectly in some circumstances. This bug is now
fixed now but if you find your errors look incorrect please try upgrading
your rebar3 version by running `rebar3 local upgrade`.


## Alternative patterns

Sometimes when writing case expressions we want multiple different clauses to
be able to trigger the same clause with different shaped data. To meet this
need we're introducing alternative patterns, separated by the `|` operator.

In this case expression the first clause will match if the variable `number`
holds 2, 4, 6 or 8.

```gleam
case number {
  2 | 4 | 6 | 8 -> "This is an even number"
  1 | 3 | 5 | 7 -> "This is an odd number"
  _ -> "I'm not sure"
}
```


## Clause guards

Sometimes when pattern matching we want to assert that two variables have the
same value. Before this release we'd need to nested case expressions, now we
have clause guards.

```gleam
case xs {
  [a, b] if a == b -> "Two equal elements"
  [a, b] if a != b -> "Two unequal elements"
  _other -> "Something else"
}
```


## Named sub-patterns

Sometimes when pattern matching we want to assign a name to a value while
specifying it's shape at the same time. With this release we can now do this
using the `as` keyword.

```gleam
case xs {
  [[_, _] as inner_list] -> inner_list
  other -> []
}
```


## Type aliases

Sometimes it can be tiring writing long type names in function annotations
such as `Result(List(tuple(String, String)), Nil)`, often we'd rather write a
short alias instead such as `Option(Headers)`. With type aliases this is now
possible.


```gleam
pub type Option(value) =
  Result(value, Nil)

pub type Headers =
  List(tuple(String, String))

pub fn headers() -> Option(Headers) {
  Ok([tuple("x-served-by", "Gleam")])
}
```

The `Option(value)` alias above is often pretty useful! If you want to use it
it is defined in the `gleam/result` module of the Gleam standard library.


## Windows support

The Gleam compiler's test suite is now running successfully on Windows, and a
Windows binary is being compiled for new releases. If you're developing on
Windows please do give it a try and let us know of any problems you encounter.


## The rest

In addition to these changes there's been a bunch of bug fixes, performance
improvements, and refactorings to the compiler. Please see the
[changelog](https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for
more detail.

Gleam can continue to improve.
