  <h2>Why Gleam?</h2>

  <h3 data-before-icon="â˜”">Safe</h3>
  <p>
    Gleam's powerful static type system helps find and prevent bugs at
    compile time, long before it reaches your users. It also serves as a
    productive refactoring tool, enabling programmers to confidently make
    large changes to unfamiliar code, quickly and with low risk.
  </p>
  <p>
    For problems the type system can't solve (such as your server being hit
    by a bolt of lightning) the Erlang virtual machine provides well tested
    mechanisms for gracefully handling failure.
  </p>

  <h3 data-before-icon="ðŸ’œ">Friendly</h3>
  <p>
    Hunting down bugs can be stressful so Gleam's compiler provides clear
    and helpful feedback about any problems. We want to spend more time
    developing features and less time looking for bugs or deciphering
    cryptic error messages.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a community we want to be friendly too. People of all backgrounds,
    genders, and experience levels are welcome and must receive equal
    respect. See our <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">community code of conduct</a>
    for more.
  </p>

  <h3 data-before-icon="ðŸ§µ">Performant</h3>
  <p>
    Gleam builds on top of the Erlang virtual machine, a best-in-class
    runtime that has enabled companies such as
    <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a>,
    <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en">Ericsson</a>,
    <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.klarna.com/">Klarna</a> to provide low-latency
    services at a global scale. Gleam takes full advantage of the Erlang
    runtime and adds no overhead of its own, so all Gleam programs are as
    blazingly fast as their Erlang counterpart.
  </p>

  <h3 data-before-icon="ðŸ§©">Erlang compatible</h3>
  <p>
    Gleam makes it easy to use code written in other BEAM languages such as
    Erlang, Elixir and LFE, so there's a rich ecosystem of
    <a href="https://hex.pm/">thousands of open source libraries </a>
    for Gleam users to make use of.
  </p>
  <p>
    In return Gleam code can be easily used by programmers of other BEAM
    languages, either by transparently making use of libraries written in
    Gleam, or by adding Gleam modules to their existing project with minimal
    fuss.
  </p>

  <h2>Examples</h2>

  <details class="openable-example" open>
    <summary>Hello, world!</summary>

    The classic example program that prints "Hello, world!" to the console.

{% highlight rust %}
import gleam/io

pub fn main() {
  io.println("Hello, world!")
}
{% endhighlight %}
  </details>

  <details class="openable-example">
    <summary>A basic web server</summary>

    This little web server responds with the text "Hello, world!" to any
    HTTP request made to it.

{% highlight rust %}
import gleam/bit_builder
import gleam/http/elli
import gleam/http

pub fn my_service(_req) {
  let body = bit_builder.from_string("Hello, world!")

  http.response(200)
  |> http.set_resp_body(body)
}

pub fn start() {
  elli.start(my_service, on_port: 3000)
}
{% endhighlight %}

    The web server created by this code is fully asynchronous and
    multi-threaded, seamlessly making use of all the cores of your computer
    without tricky locks, callbacks, or promises.
  </details>

  <details class="openable-example">
    <summary>Multi-threaded hello world</summary>

    Thanks to the powerful Erlang virtual machine Gleam programs can spin up
    hundreds thousands of threads (called processes) without any trouble.
    Here's "Hello, World!" being printed by a thousand processes
    concurrently.

{% highlight rust %}
import gleam/io
import gleam/int
import gleam/list
import gleam/string
import gleam/otp/process

pub fn main() {
  list.range(0, 1000)
  |> list.each(start_process)
}

fn start_process(i) {
  process.start(fn() {
    let message = string.append("Hello world: ", int.to_string(i))
    io.println(message)
  })
}
{% endhighlight %}

    In addition to this low-level process abstraction Gleam has helpful
    libraries full of building blocks for writing type safe and fault
    tolerant multi-core programs as quickly as possible.
