      <p>
        No nulls, no exceptions, clear error messages, and a practical type

        designed to make your job as fun and stress-free as possible.

        With Gleam's custom types, generics, and pattern matching features it
        can implement your business logic precisely and clearly. We think it
        should always be clear to the reader what code is doing.

      <h3>Ready out of the box</h3>
      <p>
        Gleam comes with compiler, build tool, formatter, editor integrations,
        and package manager all built in, so creating a gleam project is just
        running <code>gleam new</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the wider BEAM ecosystem, Gleam programs can use the thousands
        of published packages whether they are written in Gleam, Erlang, or
        Elixir.

      <h3>Made for production</h3>
      <p>
        Running on the battle-tested Erlang virtual machine that powers planet
        scale systems such as WhatsApp and Ericsson, Gleam is ready for
        workloads of any size.
      </p
      <p>
        Thanks to a multi-core actor based concurrency system that can run
        millions of concurrent tasks, fast immutable data structures, and a
        concurrent garbage collector that never stops the world, your service
        can scale and stay lightning fast with ease.
      </p>
    </div>
    <pre><code class="language-gleam">pub fn main() {
  // Run a million threads, no problem
  list.range(0, 1_000_000)
  |> list.map(spawn_task)
  |> list.each(task.await_forever)
}

fn spawn_task(i) {
  task.async(fn() {
    let n = int.to_string(i)
    io.println("Hello from " <> n)
  })
}

      <h3>Compiles to TypeScript &amp; JavaScript</h3>
      <p>
        As well as running on the Erlang VM, Gleam code can also compile to
        JavaScript. Reuse your existing backend code in the browser, on mobile
        devices, or anywhere else JavaScript can run. Gleam can also autogenerate
        .d.ts-definitions for first class TypeScript integration.
      </p>
    </div>
    <pre><code class="language-gleam">pub fn main() {
  try el = document.query_selector("button")

  element.add_event_listener(el, fn() {

  <h2>Gleam's principles</h2>

  <h3 data-before-icon="â˜”">Safe</h3>
  <p>
    Gleam's powerful static type system helps find and prevent bugs at
    compile time, long before it reaches your users. It also serves as a
    productive refactoring tool, enabling programmers to confidently make
    large changes to unfamiliar code, quickly and with low risk.
  </p>
  <p>
    For problems the type system can't solve (such as your server being hit
    by a bolt of lightning) the Erlang virtual machine provides well tested
    mechanisms for gracefully handling failure.
  </p>

  <h3 data-before-icon="ðŸ’œ">Friendly</h3>
  <p>
    Hunting down bugs can be stressful so Gleam's compiler provides clear
    and helpful feedback about any problems. We want to spend more time
    developing features and less time looking for bugs or deciphering
    cryptic error messages.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a community we want to be friendly too. People of all backgrounds,
    genders, and experience levels are welcome and must receive equal
    respect. See our <a href="https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">community code of conduct</a>
    for more.
  </p>

  <h3 data-before-icon="ðŸ§µ">Performant</h3>
  <p>
    Gleam builds on top of the Erlang virtual machine, a best-in-class
    runtime that has enabled companies such as
    <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>,
    <a href="https://www.ericsson.com/en">Ericsson</a>,
    <a href="https://www.heroku.com">Heroku</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/">WhatsApp</a> to provide low-latency
    services at a global scale. Gleam takes full advantage of the Erlang
    runtime and adds no overhead of its own, so all Gleam programs are as
    fast and as efficiently multi-threaded as their Erlang counterpart.
  </p>

  <h3 data-before-icon="ðŸ§©">Erlang compatible</h3>
  <p>
    Gleam makes it easy to use code written in other BEAM languages such as
    Erlang, Elixir and LFE, so there's a rich ecosystem of
    <a href="https://hex.pm/">thousands of open source libraries </a>
    for Gleam users to make use of.
  </p>
  <p>
    In return Gleam code can be easily used by programmers of other BEAM
    languages, either by transparently making use of libraries written in
    Gleam, or by adding Gleam modules to their existing project with minimal
    fuss.
